IBM COS SDK for Python Documentation
===============================
`ibm_boto3` is the IBM COS SDK for Python, which allows Python
developers to write software that makes use of IBM's COS service.  It is a fork of the `boto3` library that has been adapted to use IBM Cloud IAM for authentication in addition to HMAC signatures (ie AWS V4 authorization headers).

`ibm_boto3` provides an easy to use, object-oriented API as well as low-level
direct service access.

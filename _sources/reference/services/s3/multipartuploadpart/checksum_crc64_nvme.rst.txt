.. py:attribute:: S3.MultipartUploadPart.checksum_crc64_nvme

  

  - *(string) --* 

    The Base64 encoded, 64-bit ``CRC64NVME`` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the ``CRC64NVME`` checksum algorithm, or if the object was uploaded without a checksum (and Amazon S3 added the default checksum, ``CRC64NVME``, to the uploaded object). For more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

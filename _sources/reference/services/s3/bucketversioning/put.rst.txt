.. py:method:: S3.BucketVersioning.put(**kwargs)

  

  Sets the versioning state of an existing bucket.

   

  You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:

   

  **Enabled**—Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

   

  **Suspended**—Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

   

  If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no versioning state; a `GetBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html>`__ request does not return a versioning state value.

   

  In order to enable MFA Delete, you must be the bucket owner. If you are the bucket owner and want to enable MFA Delete in the bucket versioning configuration, you must include the ``x-amz-mfa request`` header and the ``Status`` and the ``MfaDelete`` request elements in a request to set the versioning state of the bucket.

   

  .. warning::

     

    If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.) For more information, see `Lifecycle and Versioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-and-other-bucket-config>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = bucket_versioning.put(
        ChecksumAlgorithm='CRC32'|'CRC32C'|'SHA1'|'SHA256'|'CRC64NVME',
        MFA='string',
        VersioningConfiguration={
            'MFADelete': 'Enabled'|'Disabled',
            'Status': 'Enabled'|'Suspended'
        },
        ExpectedBucketOwner='string'
    )
    
  :type ChecksumAlgorithm: string
  :param ChecksumAlgorithm: 

    Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the request when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding ``x-amz-checksum`` or ``x-amz-trailer`` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code ``400 Bad Request``. For more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided ``ChecksumAlgorithm`` parameter.

    

  
  :type MFA: string
  :param MFA: 

    The concatenation of the authentication device's serial number, a space, and the value that is displayed on your authentication device.

    

  
  :type VersioningConfiguration: dict
  :param VersioningConfiguration: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Container for setting the versioning state.

    

  
    - **MFADelete** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether MFA delete is enabled in the bucket versioning configuration. This element is only returned if the bucket has been configured with MFA delete. If the bucket has never been so configured, this element is not returned.

      

    
    - **Status** *(string) --* 

      The versioning state of the bucket.

      

    
  
  :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
  :param ExpectedBucketOwner: Ignored by COS if present.

  
  
  :returns: None

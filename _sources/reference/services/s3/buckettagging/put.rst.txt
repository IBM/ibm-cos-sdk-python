.. py:method:: S3.BucketTagging.put(**kwargs)

  

  Sets the tags for a bucket.

   

  Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see `Cost Allocation and Tagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html>`__ and `Using Cost Allocation in Amazon S3 Bucket Tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CostAllocTagging.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    When this operation sets the tags for a bucket, it will overwrite any current tags the bucket already has. You cannot use this operation to add tags to an existing list of tags.

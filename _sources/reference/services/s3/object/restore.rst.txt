.. py:attribute:: S3.Object.restore

  

  - *(string) --* 

    If the object is an archived object (an object whose storage class is GLACIER), the response includes this header if either the archive restoration is in progress (see `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__ or an archive copy is already restored.

     

    If an archive copy is already restored, the header value indicates when Amazon S3 is scheduled to delete the object copy. For example:

     

    ``x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Fri, 21 Dec 2012 00:00:00 GMT"``

     

    If the object restoration is in progress, the header returns the value ``ongoing-request="true"``.

     

    For more information about archiving objects, see `Transitioning Objects\: General Considerations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-transition-general-considerations>`__.

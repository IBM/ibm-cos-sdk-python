.. py:method:: S3.Client.list_bucket_metrics_configurations(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the metrics configurations for the bucket. The metrics configurations are only for the request metrics of the bucket and do not provide information on daily storage metrics. You can have up to 1,000 configurations per bucket.

   

  This action supports list pagination and does not return more than 100 configurations at a time. Always check the ``IsTruncated`` element in the response. If there are no more configurations to list, ``IsTruncated`` is set to false. If there are more configurations to list, ``IsTruncated`` is set to true, and there is a value in ``NextContinuationToken``. You use the ``NextContinuationToken`` value to continue the pagination of the list by passing the value in ``continuation-token`` in the request to ``GET`` the next page.

   

  To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:GetMetricsConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

   

  For more information about metrics configurations and CloudWatch request metrics, see `Monitoring Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudwatch-monitoring.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_bucket_metrics_configurations(
        Bucket='string',
        ContinuationToken='string',
        ExpectedBucketOwner='string'
    )
    
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the bucket containing the metrics configurations to retrieve.

    

  
  :type ContinuationToken: string
  :param ContinuationToken: 

    The marker that is used to continue a metrics configuration listing that has been truncated. Use the ``NextContinuationToken`` from a previously truncated list response to continue the listing. The continuation token is an opaque value that Amazon S3 understands.

    

  
  :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
  :param ExpectedBucketOwner: Ignored by COS if present.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        Indicates whether the returned list of metrics configurations is complete. A value of true indicates that the list is not complete and the NextContinuationToken will be provided for a subsequent request.

        
      

      - **ContinuationToken** *(string) --* 

        The marker that is used as a starting point for this metrics configuration list response. This value is present if it was sent in the request.

        
      

      - **NextContinuationToken** *(string) --* 

        The marker used to continue a metrics configuration listing that has been truncated. Use the ``NextContinuationToken`` from a previously truncated list response to continue the listing. The continuation token is an opaque value that Amazon S3 understands.

        
      

      - **MetricsConfigurationList** *(list) --* 

        The list of metrics configurations for a bucket.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Specifies a metrics configuration for the CloudWatch request metrics (specified by the metrics configuration ID) from an Amazon S3 bucket. If you're updating an existing metrics configuration, note that this is a full replacement of the existing metrics configuration. If you don't include the elements you want to keep, they are erased. For more information, see `PutBucketMetricsConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTMetricConfiguration.html>`__.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The ID used to identify the metrics configuration. The ID has a 64 character limit and can only contain letters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores.

            
          

          - **Filter** *(dict) --* 

            Specifies a metrics configuration filter. The metrics configuration will only include objects that meet the filter's criteria. A filter must be a prefix, an object tag, an access point ARN, or a conjunction (MetricsAndOperator).

            
            

            - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

              The prefix used when evaluating a metrics filter.

              
            

            - **Tag** *(dict) --* 

              The tag used when evaluating a metrics filter.

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                Name of the object key.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                Value of the tag.

                
          
            

            - **And** *(dict) --* 

              A conjunction (logical AND) of predicates, which is used in evaluating a metrics filter. The operator must have at least two predicates, and an object must match all of the predicates in order for the filter to apply.

              
              

              - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

                The prefix used when evaluating an AND predicate.

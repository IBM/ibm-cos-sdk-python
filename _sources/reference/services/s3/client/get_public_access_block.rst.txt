.. py:method:: S3.Client.get_public_access_block(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have the ``s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock`` permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__.

   

  .. warning::

     

    When Amazon S3 evaluates the ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration for a bucket or an object, it checks the ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account. If the ``PublicAccessBlock`` settings are different between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level settings.

     

   

  For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an object public, see `The Meaning of "Public" <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status>`__.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'PublicAccessBlockConfiguration': {
              'BlockPublicAcls': True|False,

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **PublicAccessBlockConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        The ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration currently in effect for this Amazon S3 bucket.

        
        

        - **BlockPublicAcls** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes the following behavior:

           

          
          * PUT Bucket ACL and PUT Object ACL calls fail if the specified ACL is public.
           
          * PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
           
          * PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
          

           

          Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

          
        

        - **IgnorePublicAcls** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on this bucket and objects in this bucket.

           

          Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

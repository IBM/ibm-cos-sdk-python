.. py:method:: S3.Client.get_bucket_website(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the website configuration for a bucket. To host website on Amazon S3, you can configure a bucket as website by adding a website configuration. For more information about hosting websites, see `Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html>`__.

   

  This GET action requires the ``S3:GetBucketWebsite`` permission. By default, only the bucket owner can read the bucket website configuration. However, bucket owners can allow other users to read the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the ``S3:GetBucketWebsite`` permission.

        - **HostName** *(string) --*

      - **RoutingRules** *(list) --* 

        Rules that define when a redirect is applied and the redirect behavior.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Specifies the redirect behavior and when a redirect is applied. For more information about routing rules, see `Configuring advanced conditional redirects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html#advanced-conditional-redirects>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

          
          

          - **Condition** *(dict) --* 

            A container for describing a condition that must be met for the specified redirect to apply. For example, 1. If request is for pages in the ``/docs`` folder, redirect to the ``/documents`` folder. 2. If request results in HTTP error 4xx, redirect request to another host where you might process the error.

            
            

            - **HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals** *(string) --* 

              The HTTP error code when the redirect is applied. In the event of an error, if the error code equals this value, then the specified redirect is applied. Required when parent element ``Condition`` is specified and sibling ``KeyPrefixEquals`` is not specified. If both are specified, then both must be true for the redirect to be applied.

              
            

            - **KeyPrefixEquals** *(string) --* 

              The object key name prefix when the redirect is applied. For example, to redirect requests for ``ExamplePage.html``, the key prefix will be ``ExamplePage.html``. To redirect request for all pages with the prefix ``docs/``, the key prefix will be ``/docs``, which identifies all objects in the ``docs/`` folder. Required when the parent element ``Condition`` is specified and sibling ``HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals`` is not specified. If both conditions are specified, both must be true for the redirect to be applied.

          - **Redirect** *(dict) --* 

            Container for redirect information. You can redirect requests to another host, to another page, or with another protocol. In the event of an error, you can specify a different error code to return.

            
            

            - **HostName** *(string) --*

            - **ReplaceKeyPrefixWith** *(string) --* 

              The object key prefix to use in the redirect request. For example, to redirect requests for all pages with prefix ``docs/`` (objects in the ``docs/`` folder) to ``documents/``, you can set a condition block with ``KeyPrefixEquals`` set to ``docs/`` and in the Redirect set ``ReplaceKeyPrefixWith`` to ``/documents``. Not required if one of the siblings is present. Can be present only if ``ReplaceKeyWith`` is not provided.

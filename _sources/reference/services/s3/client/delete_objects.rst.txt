.. py:method:: S3.Client.delete_objects(**kwargs)

  

  This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

   

  The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

   

  The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body.

   

  When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete>`__.

   

  Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.delete_objects(
        Bucket='string',
        Delete={
            'Objects': [
                {
                    'Key': 'string',
                    'VersionId': 'string'
                },
            ],
            'Quiet': True|False
        },
        MFA='string',
        RequestPayer='requester',
        BypassGovernanceRetention=True|False,
        ExpectedBucketOwner='string'
    )
    
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The bucket name containing the objects to delete.

     

    **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ``Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com``. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Availability Zone. Bucket names must follow the format ``bucket_base_name--az-id--x-s3`` (for example, ``DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az2--x-s3``). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see `Directory bucket naming rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

      

     

    **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ``AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com``. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see `What is S3 on Outposts? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    

  
  :type Delete: dict
  :param Delete: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Container for the request.

    

  
    - **Objects** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The object to delete.

       

      .. note::

        

        **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, an object that's composed entirely of whitespace characters is not supported by the ``DeleteObjects`` API operation. The request will receive a ``400 Bad Request`` error and none of the objects in the request will be deleted.

        

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Object Identifier is unique value to identify objects.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Key name of the object.

           

          .. warning::

             

            Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see `XML related object key constraints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints>`__.

            

          

        
        - **VersionId** *(string) --* 

          VersionId for the specific version of the object to delete.

          

        
      
  
    - **Quiet** *(boolean) --* 

      Element to enable quiet mode for the request. When you add this element, you must set its value to ``true``.

      

    
  
  :type MFA: string
  :param MFA: 

    The concatenation of the authentication device's serial number, a space, and the value that is displayed on your authentication device. Required to permanently delete a versioned object if versioning is configured with MFA delete enabled.

     

    When performing the ``DeleteObjects`` operation on an MFA delete enabled bucket, which attempts to delete the specified versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you don't provide an MFA token, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects that you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned object keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

          - **Message** *(string) --* 

            The error message contains a generic description of the error condition in English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs display the message directly to the end user if they encounter an error condition they don't know how or don't care to handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error handling and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error message.

            
      
    
  

  **Examples**

  The following example deletes objects from a bucket. The request specifies object versions. S3 deletes specific object versions and returns the key and versions of deleted objects in the response.
  ::

    response = client.delete_objects(
        Bucket='examplebucket',
        Delete={
            'Objects': [

  The following example deletes objects from a bucket. The bucket is versioned, and the request does not specify the object version to delete. In this case, all versions remain in the bucket and S3 adds a delete marker.

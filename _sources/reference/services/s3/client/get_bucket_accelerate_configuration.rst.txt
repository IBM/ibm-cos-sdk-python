.. py:method:: S3.Client.get_bucket_accelerate_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  This implementation of the GET action uses the ``accelerate`` subresource to return the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket, which is either ``Enabled`` or ``Suspended``. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers to and from Amazon S3.

   

  To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:GetAccelerateConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  You set the Transfer Acceleration state of an existing bucket to ``Enabled`` or ``Suspended`` by using the `PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html>`__ operation.

   

  A GET ``accelerate`` request does not return a state value for a bucket that has no transfer acceleration state. A bucket has no Transfer Acceleration state if a state has never been set on the bucket.

   

  For more information about transfer acceleration, see `Transfer Acceleration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html>`__ in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

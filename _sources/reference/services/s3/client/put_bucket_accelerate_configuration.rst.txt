.. py:method:: S3.Client.put_bucket_accelerate_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  Sets the accelerate configuration of an existing bucket. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers to Amazon S3.

   

  To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:PutAccelerateConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

   

  The Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket can be set to one of the following two values:

   

  
  * Enabled – Enables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.
   
  * Suspended – Disables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.
  

   

  The `GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html>`__ action returns the transfer acceleration state of a bucket.

   

  After setting the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket to Enabled, it might take up to thirty minutes before the data transfer rates to the bucket increase.

   

  The name of the bucket used for Transfer Acceleration must be DNS-compliant and must not contain periods (".").

   

  For more information about transfer acceleration, see `Transfer Acceleration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html>`__.

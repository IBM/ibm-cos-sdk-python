.. py:method:: S3.Client.get_bucket_replication(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the replication configuration of a bucket.

   

  .. note::

    

    It can take a while to propagate the put or delete a replication configuration to all Amazon S3 systems. Therefore, a get request soon after put or delete can return a wrong result.

    

   

  For information about replication configuration, see `Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  This action requires permissions for the ``s3:GetReplicationConfiguration`` action. For more information about permissions, see `Using Bucket Policies and User Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html>`__.

   

  If you include the ``Filter`` element in a replication configuration, you must also include the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` and ``Priority`` elements. The response also returns those elements.

   

  For information about ``GetBucketReplication`` errors, see `List of replication-related error codes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList>`__

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ReplicationConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        A container for replication rules. You can add up to 1,000 rules. The maximum size of a replication configuration is 2 MB.

        
        

        - **Role** *(string) --* Not supported by COS
        

        - **Rules** *(list) --* 

          A container for one or more replication rules. A replication configuration must have at least one rule and can contain a maximum of 1,000 rules.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Specifies which Amazon S3 objects to replicate and where to store the replicas.

            
            

            - **ID** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters.

              
            

            - **Priority** *(integer) --* 

              The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority.

               

              For more information, see `Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.

              
            

            - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

              An object key name prefix that identifies the object or objects to which the rule applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects in a bucket, specify an empty string.

               

              .. warning::

                 

                Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see `XML related object key constraints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints>`__.

                

              
            

            - **Filter** *(dict) --* 

              Specifies which Amazon S3 objects to replicate and where to store the replicas.

              
              

              - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

                An object key name prefix that identifies the subset of objects to which the rule applies.

                
              

              - **Tag** *(dict) --* 

                A container for specifying a tag key and value.

                 

                The rule applies only to objects that have the tag in their tag set.

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  Name of the object key.

              - **And** *(dict) --* 

                A container for specifying rule filters. The filters determine the subset of objects to which the rule applies. This element is required only if you specify more than one filter. For example:

                 

                
                * If you specify both a ``Prefix`` and a ``Tag`` filter, wrap these filters in an ``And`` tag.
                 
                * If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the ``Tag`` elements in an ``And`` tag.
                

                
                

                - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

                  An object key name prefix that identifies the subset of objects to which the rule applies.

                  
                

                - **Tags** *(list) --* 

                  An array of tags containing key and value pairs.

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A container of a key value name pair.

                    
                    

                    - **Key** *(string) --* 

                      Name of the object key.

                      
                    

                    - **Value** *(string) --* 

                      Value of the tag.

                      
                
              
            
          
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              Specifies whether the rule is enabled.

              
            

            - **Destination** *(dict) --* 

              A container for information about the replication destination and its configurations including enabling the S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).

              
              

              - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to store the results.

                
              

              - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

                The storage class to use when replicating objects, such as S3 Standard or reduced redundancy. By default, Amazon S3 uses the storage class of the source object to create the object replica.

                 

                For valid values, see the ``StorageClass`` element of the `PUT Bucket replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTreplication.html>`__ action in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference*.

                
          
            

            - **DeleteMarkerReplication** *(dict) --* 

              Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If you specify a ``Filter`` in your replication configuration, you must also include a ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` element. If your ``Filter`` includes a ``Tag`` element, the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` ``Status`` must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating delete markers for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see `Basic Rule Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config>`__.

               

              For more information about delete marker replication, see `Basic Rule Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/delete-marker-replication.html>`__.

               

              .. note::

                

                If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see `Backward Compatibility <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations>`__.

                

              
              

              - **Status** *(string) --* 

                Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

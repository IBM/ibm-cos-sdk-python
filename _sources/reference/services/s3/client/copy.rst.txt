.. py:method:: S3.Client.copy(CopySource, Bucket, Key, ExtraArgs=None, Callback=None, SourceClient=None, Config=None)

    
  Copy an object from one S3 location to another.
  
  This is a managed transfer which will perform a multipart copy in
  multiple threads if necessary.
  
  Usage::
  
      import ibm_boto3
      s3 = ibm_boto3.resource('s3')
      copy_source = {
          'Bucket': 'mybucket',
          'Key': 'mykey'
      }
      s3.meta.client.copy(copy_source, 'otherbucket', 'otherkey')
  
  :type CopySource: dict
  :param CopySource: The name of the source bucket, key name of the
      source object, and optional version ID of the source object. The
      dictionary format is:
      ``{'Bucket': 'bucket', 'Key': 'key', 'VersionId': 'id'}``. Note
      that the ``VersionId`` key is optional and may be omitted.
  
  :type Bucket: str
  :param Bucket: The name of the bucket to copy to
  
  :type Key: str
  :param Key: The name of the key to copy to
  
  :type ExtraArgs: dict
  :param ExtraArgs: Extra arguments that may be passed to the

  :type Callback: function
  :param Callback: A method which takes a number of bytes transferred to
      be periodically called during the copy.
  
  :type SourceClient: ibm_botocore or ibm_boto3 Client
  :param SourceClient: The client to be used for operation that
      may happen at the source object. For example, this client is
      used for the head_object that determines the size of the copy.

      for the source object.

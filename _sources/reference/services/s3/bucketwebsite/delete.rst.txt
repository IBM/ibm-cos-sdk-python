.. py:method:: S3.BucketWebsite.delete(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

    

   

  This action removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a ``200 OK`` response upon successfully deleting a website configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a ``200 OK`` response if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a ``404`` response if the bucket specified in the request does not exist.

   

  This DELETE action requires the ``S3:DeleteBucketWebsite`` permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the ``S3:DeleteBucketWebsite`` permission.

  - *(list) --* 

    Rules that define when a redirect is applied and the redirect behavior.

    
    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the redirect behavior and when a redirect is applied. For more information about routing rules, see `Configuring advanced conditional redirects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html#advanced-conditional-redirects>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

      
      

      - **Condition** *(dict) --* 

        A container for describing a condition that must be met for the specified redirect to apply. For example, 1. If request is for pages in the ``/docs`` folder, redirect to the ``/documents`` folder. 2. If request results in HTTP error 4xx, redirect request to another host where you might process the error.

        
        

        - **HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals** *(string) --* 

          The HTTP error code when the redirect is applied. In the event of an error, if the error code equals this value, then the specified redirect is applied. Required when parent element ``Condition`` is specified and sibling ``KeyPrefixEquals`` is not specified. If both are specified, then both must be true for the redirect to be applied.

          
        

        - **KeyPrefixEquals** *(string) --* 

          The object key name prefix when the redirect is applied. For example, to redirect requests for ``ExamplePage.html``, the key prefix will be ``ExamplePage.html``. To redirect request for all pages with the prefix ``docs/``, the key prefix will be ``/docs``, which identifies all objects in the ``docs/`` folder. Required when the parent element ``Condition`` is specified and sibling ``HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals`` is not specified. If both conditions are specified, both must be true for the redirect to be applied.

            Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see `XML related object key constraints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints>`__.

            

          
    
      

      - **Redirect** *(dict) --* 

        Container for redirect information. You can redirect requests to another host, to another page, or with another protocol. In the event of an error, you can specify a different error code to return.

        
        

        - **HostName** *(string) --* 

          The host name to use in the redirect request.

          
        

        - **HttpRedirectCode** *(string) --* 

          The HTTP redirect code to use on the response. Not required if one of the siblings is present.

          
        

        - **Protocol** *(string) --* 

          Protocol to use when redirecting requests. The default is the protocol that is used in the original request.

          
        

        - **ReplaceKeyPrefixWith** *(string) --* 

          The object key prefix to use in the redirect request. For example, to redirect requests for all pages with prefix ``docs/`` (objects in the ``docs/`` folder) to ``documents/``, you can set a condition block with ``KeyPrefixEquals`` set to ``docs/`` and in the Redirect set ``ReplaceKeyPrefixWith`` to ``/documents``. Not required if one of the siblings is present. Can be present only if ``ReplaceKeyWith`` is not provided.

        - **ReplaceKeyWith** *(string) --* 

          The specific object key to use in the redirect request. For example, redirect request to ``error.html``. Not required if one of the siblings is present. Can be present only if ``ReplaceKeyPrefixWith`` is not provided.

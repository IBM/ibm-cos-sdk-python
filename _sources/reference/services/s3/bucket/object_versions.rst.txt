.. py:attribute:: S3.Bucket.object_versions

  A collection of ObjectVersion resources.A ObjectVersion Collection will include all resources by default, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

  .. py:method:: all()

    Creates an iterable of all ObjectVersion resources in the collection.

  .. py:method:: delete(**kwargs)

    

    This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

     

    The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

     

    The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body.

     

    When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete>`__.

     

    Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.

    :param MFA: 

      The concatenation of the authentication device's serial number, a space, and the value that is displayed on your authentication device. Required to permanently delete a versioned object if versioning is configured with MFA delete enabled.

       

      When performing the ``DeleteObjects`` operation on an MFA delete enabled bucket, which attempts to delete the specified versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you don't provide an MFA token, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects that you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned object keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

       

      .. note::

        

        This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          - *(dict) --* 

            Information about the deleted object.

            - **Message** *(string) --* 

              The error message contains a generic description of the error condition in English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs display the message directly to the end user if they encounter an error condition they don't know how or don't care to handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error handling and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error message.

              
        
      
    

  .. py:method:: filter(**kwargs)

    Creates an iterable of all ObjectVersion resources in the collection filtered by kwargs passed to method. A ObjectVersion collection will include all resources by default if no filters are provided, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

    ::

      object_version_iterator = bucket.object_versions.filter(
          Delimiter='string',
          EncodingType='url',
          KeyMarker='string',
          MaxKeys=123,
          Prefix='string',
          VersionIdMarker='string',
          ExpectedBucketOwner='string'
      )
      
    :type Delimiter: string
    :param Delimiter: 

      A delimiter is a character that you specify to group keys. All keys that contain the same string between the ``prefix`` and the first occurrence of the delimiter are grouped under a single result element in ``CommonPrefixes``. These groups are counted as one result against the ``max-keys`` limitation. These keys are not returned elsewhere in the response.

      

    
    :type EncodingType: string
    :param EncodingType: 

      Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and specifies the encoding method to use. An object key can contain any Unicode character; however, the XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

      

    
    :type KeyMarker: string
    :param KeyMarker: 

      Specifies the key to start with when listing objects in a bucket.

      

    
    :type MaxKeys: integer
    :param MaxKeys: 

      Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default, the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more. If additional keys satisfy the search criteria, but were not returned because ``max-keys`` was exceeded, the response contains ``<isTruncated>true</isTruncated>``. To return the additional keys, see ``key-marker`` and ``version-id-marker``.

      

    
    :type Prefix: string
    :param Prefix: 

      Use this parameter to select only those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different groupings of keys. (You can think of using ``prefix`` to make groups in the same way that you'd use a folder in a file system.) You can use ``prefix`` with ``delimiter`` to roll up numerous objects into a single result under ``CommonPrefixes``.

      

    
    :type VersionIdMarker: string
    :param VersionIdMarker: 

      Specifies the object version you want to start listing from.

      

    
    :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
    :param ExpectedBucketOwner: Ignored by COS if present.

    Creates an iterable up to a specified amount of ObjectVersion resources in the collection.

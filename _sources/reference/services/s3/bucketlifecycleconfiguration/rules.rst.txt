  - *(list) --* 

    Container for a lifecycle rule.

    
    

    - *(dict) --*

      - **Expiration** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies the expiration for the lifecycle of the object in the form of date, days and, whether the object has a delete marker.

        
        

        - **Date** *(datetime) --* 

          Indicates at what date the object is to be moved or deleted. The date value must conform to the ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC.

          
        

        - **Days** *(integer) --* 

          Indicates the lifetime, in days, of the objects that are subject to the rule. The value must be a non-zero positive integer.

          
        

        - **ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether Amazon S3 will remove a delete marker with no noncurrent versions. If set to true, the delete marker will be expired; if set to false the policy takes no action. This cannot be specified with Days or Date in a Lifecycle Expiration Policy.

          
    
      

      - **ID** *(string) --*

        The ``Filter`` is used to identify objects that a Lifecycle Rule applies to. A ``Filter`` must have exactly one of ``Prefix``, ``Tag``, or ``And`` specified. ``Filter`` is required if the ``LifecycleRule`` does not containt a ``Prefix`` element.

            Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see `XML related object key constraints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints>`__.

            

          
        

        - **Tag** *(dict) --* 

          This tag must exist in the object's tag set in order for the rule to apply.

        - *(dict) --* 

          Specifies when an object transitions to a specified storage class. For more information about Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration rules, see `Transitioning Objects Using Amazon S3 Lifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

          
          

          - **Date** *(datetime) --* 

            Indicates when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class. The date value must be in ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC.

            
          

          - **Days** *(integer) --* 

            Indicates the number of days after creation when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class. The value must be a positive integer.

            
          

          - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

            The storage class to which you want the object to transition.

            
      
    
      

      - **NoncurrentVersionExpiration** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expiration, Amazon S3 permanently deletes the noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle configuration action on a bucket that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in the object's lifetime.

        
        

        - **NoncurrentDays** *(integer) --* 

          Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3 can perform the associated action. The value must be a non-zero positive integer. For information about the noncurrent days calculations, see `How Amazon S3 Calculates When an Object Became Noncurrent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#non-current-days-calculations>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

          
    
      

      - **AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies the days since the initiation of an incomplete multipart upload that Amazon S3 will wait before permanently removing all parts of the upload. For more information, see `Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        
        

        - **DaysAfterInitiation** *(integer) --* 

          Specifies the number of days after which Amazon S3 aborts an incomplete multipart upload.

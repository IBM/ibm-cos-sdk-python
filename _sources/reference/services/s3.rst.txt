  .. py:method:: abort_multipart_upload(**kwargs)

    

    This action aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts. 

     

    To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the part storage, you should call the `ListParts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html>`__ action and ensure that the parts list is empty.

     

    For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload, see `Multipart Upload and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__.

     

    The following operations are related to ``AbortMultipartUpload`` :

     

     
    * `CreateMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html>`__   
     
    * `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__

  .. py:method:: add_legal_hold(**kwargs)

    Add a legal hold on an object. The legal hold identifiers are stored in the object metadata along with the timestamp of when they are POSTed to the object. The presence of any legal hold identifiers prevents the modification or deletion of the object data, even if the retention period has expired. Legal Holds can only be added to objects in a bucket with a protection policy. Otherwise a 400 error will be returned.

    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: close()

        
    Closes underlying endpoint connections.


  .. py:method:: complete_multipart_upload(**kwargs)

    

    Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.

     

    You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__ operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this action to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This action concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the ``ETag`` value, returned after that part was uploaded.

     

    Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response body to determine whether the request succeeded.

     

    Note that if ``CompleteMultipartUpload`` fails, applications should be prepared to retry the failed requests. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Error Best Practices <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ErrorBestPractices.html>`__.

     

    .. warning::

       

      You cannot use ``Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` with Complete Multipart Upload requests. Also, if you do not provide a ``Content-Type`` header, ``CompleteMultipartUpload`` returns a 200 OK response.

       

     

    For more information about multipart uploads, see `Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html>`__.

     

    For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see `Multipart Upload and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__.

     

     ``CompleteMultipartUpload`` has the following special errors:

     

     
    * Error code: ``EntityTooSmall``   

       
      * Description: Your proposed upload is smaller than the minimum allowed object size. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. 
       
      * 400 Bad Request 
       

     
     
    * Error code: ``InvalidPart``   

       
      * Description: One or more of the specified parts could not be found. The part might not have been uploaded, or the specified entity tag might not have matched the part's entity tag. 
       
      * 400 Bad Request 
       

     
     
    * Error code: ``InvalidPartOrder``   

       
      * Description: The list of parts was not in ascending order. The parts list must be specified in order by part number. 
       
      * 400 Bad Request 
       

     
     
    * Error code: ``NoSuchUpload``   

       
      * Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed. 
       
      * 404 Not Found

          The name of the bucket that contains the newly created object. Does not return the access point ARN or access point alias if used.

           

          When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName* -*AccountId* .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

           

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ``AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

          
        

        - **Key** *(string) --* 

          The object key of the newly created object.

          
        

        - **Expiration** *(string) --* 

          If the object expiration is configured, this will contain the expiration date ( ``expiry-date`` ) and rule ID ( ``rule-id`` ). The value of ``rule-id`` is URL-encoded.

          
        

        - **ETag** *(string) --* 

          Entity tag that identifies the newly created object's data. Objects with different object data will have different entity tags. The entity tag is an opaque string. The entity tag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object data. If the entity tag is not an MD5 digest of the object data, it will contain one or more nonhexadecimal characters and/or will consist of less than 32 or more than 32 hexadecimal digits. For more information about how the entity tag is calculated, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

          
        

        - **ServerSideEncryption** *(string) --* 

          If you specified server-side encryption either with an Amazon S3-managed encryption key or an Amazon Web Services KMS key in your initiate multipart upload request, the response includes this header. It confirms the encryption algorithm that Amazon S3 used to encrypt the object.

          
        

        - **VersionId** *(string) --* 

          Version ID of the newly created object, in case the bucket has versioning turned on.

          
        

        - **SSEKMSKeyId** *(string) --* 

          If present, specifies the ID of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) symmetric customer managed key that was used for the object.

          
        

        - **BucketKeyEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether the multipart upload uses an S3 Bucket Key for server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS (SSE-KMS).

          
        

        - **RequestCharged** *(string) --* 

          If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

          
    

    **Examples** 

    The following example completes a multipart upload.

  .. py:method:: copy_object(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

     

    .. note::

       

      You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy) API. For more information, see `Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html>`__.

       

     

    All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have *read* access to the source object and *write* access to the destination bucket. For more information, see `REST Authentication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html>`__. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.

     

    A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the ``200 OK`` response. This means that a ``200 OK`` response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.

     

    If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.

     

    .. note::

       

      If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.

       

     

    The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see `Amazon S3 pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/>`__.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 ``Bad Request`` error. For more information, see `Transfer Acceleration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html>`__.

       

     

     **Metadata**  

     

    When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see `Using ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__. 

     

    To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the ``x-amz-metadata-directive`` header. When you grant permissions, you can use the ``s3:x-amz-metadata-directive`` condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see `Specifying Conditions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys, see `Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html>`__.

     

     **x-amz-copy-source-if Headers**  

     

    To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the ``Etag`` matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the following request parameters:

     

     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match``   
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match``   
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since``   
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since``   
     

     

    If both the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` and copies the data:

     

     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` condition evaluates to true 
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` condition evaluates to false 
     

     

    If both the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the ``412 Precondition Failed`` response code:

     

     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` condition evaluates to false 
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` condition evaluates to true 
     

     

    .. note::

       

      All headers with the ``x-amz-`` prefix, including ``x-amz-copy-source`` , must be signed.

       

     

     **Server-side encryption**  

     

    When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the object using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see `Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__.

     

    If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Bucket Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers**  

     

    When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ and `Managing ACLs Using the REST API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html>`__. 

     

    If the bucket that you're copying objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the ``bucket-owner-full-control`` canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format.

     

    For more information, see `Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.

       

     

     **Checksums**  

     

    When copying an object, if it has a checksum, that checksum will be copied to the new object by default. When you copy the object over, you may optionally specify a different checksum algorithm to use with the ``x-amz-checksum-algorithm`` header.

     

     **Storage Class Options**  

     

    You can use the ``CopyObject`` action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the ``StorageClass`` parameter. For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

     

    If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the ``x-amz-version-id`` response header in the response.

     

    If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.

     

    If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__.

     

    The following operations are related to ``CopyObject`` :

     

     
    * `PutObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html>`__   
     
    * `GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html>`__   
     

     

    For more information, see `Copying Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjectsExamples.html>`__.

    :type Bucket: string
    :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the destination bucket.

       

      When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName* -*AccountId* .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

      When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ``AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

  .. py:method:: create_bucket(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.

     

    Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket naming restrictions, see `Bucket naming rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html>`__.

     

    If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see `Create Bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html>`__. 

     

    By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see `Accessing a bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

      If you send your create bucket request to the ``s3.amazonaws.com`` endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see `Virtual hosting of buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html>`__.

       

     

     **Access control lists (ACLs)**  

     

    When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally configure the bucket ACL to specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If your CreateBucket request sets bucket owner enforced for S3 Object Ownership and specifies a bucket ACL that provides access to an external Amazon Web Services account, your request fails with a ``400`` error and returns the ``InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership`` error code. For more information, see `Controlling object ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

     

    There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL using the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly using the ``x-amz-grant-read`` , ``x-amz-grant-write`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access control list (ACL) overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html>`__. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: 

       
      * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account 
       
      * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group 
       
      * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account 

      .. note::

         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

           
          * US East (N. Virginia) 
           
          * US West (N. California) 
           
          * US West (Oregon) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
           
          * Europe (Ireland) 
           
          * South America (São Paulo) 
           

         

        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

         

       
       

     

    For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:

     

     ``x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"``  

     
     

     

    .. note::

       

      You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.

       

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    In addition to ``s3:CreateBucket`` , the following permissions are required when your CreateBucket includes specific headers:

     

     
    * **ACLs** - If your ``CreateBucket`` request specifies ACL permissions and the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you specify access permissions explicitly through any other ACL, both ``s3:CreateBucket`` and ``s3:PutBucketAcl`` permissions are needed. If the ACL the ``CreateBucket`` request is private or doesn't specify any ACLs, only ``s3:CreateBucket`` permission is needed.  
     
    * **Object Lock** - If ``ObjectLockEnabledForBucket`` is set to true in your ``CreateBucket`` request, ``s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration`` and ``s3:PutBucketVersioning`` permissions are required. 
     
    * **S3 Object Ownership** - If your CreateBucket request includes the the ``x-amz-object-ownership`` header, ``s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls`` permission is required. 
     

     

    The following operations are related to ``CreateBucket`` :

     

     
    * `PutObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html>`__   
     
    * `DeleteBucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucket.html>`__

    For more information about multipart uploads, see `Multipart Upload Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html>`__.

     

    If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see `Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config>`__.

     

    For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see `Multipart Upload and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__.

     

    For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see `Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

      After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. 

       

     

    You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use Amazon Web Services KMS keys or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__ and `UploadPartCopy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html>`__ requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using ``CreateMultipartUpload`` . 

     

    To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the ``kms:Decrypt`` and ``kms:GenerateDataKey*`` actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see `Multipart upload API and permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.

     

    For more information, see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__.

      Access Permissions  

    When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__. 
     

     

    You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.

      Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers  

    You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. 

     

     
    * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer managed key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request. 

       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-context``   
       

     

    .. note::

       

      If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but don't provide ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key in Amazon Web Services KMS to protect the data.

       

     

    .. warning::

       

      All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by Amazon Web Services KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.

       

     

    For more information about server-side encryption with KMS key (SSE-KMS), see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__.

     
     
    * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request. 

       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5``   
       

     

    For more information about server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS), see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__.

     
     

      Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers  

    You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see `Using ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL ( ``x-amz-acl`` ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use: 

       
      * ``x-amz-grant-read``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-write``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-read-acp``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-write-acp``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-full-control``   
       

     

    You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

     

       
      * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account 
       
      * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group 
       
      * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account 

      .. note::

         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

           
          * US East (N. Virginia) 
           
          * US West (N. California) 
           
          * US West (Oregon) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
           
          * Europe (Ireland) 
           
          * South America (São Paulo) 
           

         

        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

         

       
       

     

    For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:

     

     ``x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"``

  .. py:method:: delete_bucket_lifecycle(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified bucket. Amazon S3 removes all the lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle subresource associated with the bucket. Your objects never expire, and Amazon S3 no longer automatically deletes any objects on the basis of rules contained in the deleted lifecycle configuration.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and the bucket owner can grant this permission to others.

     

    There is usually some time lag before lifecycle configuration deletion is fully propagated to all the Amazon S3 systems.

  .. py:method:: delete_bucket_policy(**kwargs)

    

    This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the ``DeleteBucketPolicy`` permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account to use this operation. 

     

    If you don't have ``DeleteBucketPolicy`` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a ``403 Access Denied`` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a ``405 Method Not Allowed`` error. 

     

    .. warning::

       

      As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns a bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.

  .. py:method:: delete_bucket_website(**kwargs)

    

    This action removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a ``200 OK`` response upon successfully deleting a website configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a ``200 OK`` response if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a ``404`` response if the bucket specified in the request does not exist.

     

    This DELETE action requires the ``S3:DeleteBucketWebsite`` permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the ``S3:DeleteBucketWebsite`` permission.

  .. py:method:: delete_object(**kwargs)

    

    Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but will still respond that the command was successful.

     

    To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the version Id subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header, ``x-amz-delete-marker`` , to true. 

     

    If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the ``x-amz-mfa`` request header in the DELETE ``versionId`` request. Requests that include ``x-amz-mfa`` must use HTTPS. 

     

    For more information about MFA Delete, see `Using MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMFADelete.html>`__. To see sample requests that use versioning, see `Sample Request <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html#ExampleVersionObjectDelete>`__. 

     

    You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or configure its lifecycle ( `PutBucketLifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html>`__ ) to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them the ``s3:DeleteObject`` , ``s3:DeleteObjectVersion`` , and ``s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration`` actions.

  .. py:method:: delete_objects(**kwargs)

    

    This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

     

    The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

     

    The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body.

     

    When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete>`__.

     

    Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.

            - **Message** *(string) --* 

              The error message contains a generic description of the error condition in English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs display the message directly to the end user if they encounter an error condition they don't know how or don't care to handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error handling and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error message.

              
        
      
    

    **Examples** 

    The following example deletes objects from a bucket. The request specifies object versions. S3 deletes specific object versions and returns the key and versions of deleted objects in the response.
    ::

      response = client.delete_objects(
          Bucket='examplebucket',
          Delete={
              'Objects': [
                  {
                      'Key': 'HappyFace.jpg',
                      'VersionId': '2LWg7lQLnY41.maGB5Z6SWW.dcq0vx7b',
                  },
                  {

                      'VersionId': 'yoz3HB.ZhCS_tKVEmIOr7qYyyAaZSKVd',
                  },
              ],
              'Quiet': False,
          },
      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      {
          'Deleted': [

    The following example deletes objects from a bucket. The bucket is versioned, and the request does not specify the object version to delete. In this case, all versions remain in the bucket and S3 adds a delete marker.
    ::

      response = client.delete_objects(
          Bucket='examplebucket',
          Delete={
              'Objects': [

                  {

  .. py:method:: get_bucket_accelerate_configuration(**kwargs)

    

    This implementation of the GET action uses the ``accelerate`` subresource to return the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket, which is either ``Enabled`` or ``Suspended`` . Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers to and from Amazon S3.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:GetAccelerateConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    You set the Transfer Acceleration state of an existing bucket to ``Enabled`` or ``Suspended`` by using the `PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html>`__ operation. 

     

    A GET ``accelerate`` request does not return a state value for a bucket that has no transfer acceleration state. A bucket has no Transfer Acceleration state if a state has never been set on the bucket. 

     

    For more information about transfer acceleration, see `Transfer Acceleration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html>`__ in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

  .. py:method:: get_bucket_acl(**kwargs)

    

    This implementation of the ``GET`` action uses the ``acl`` subresource to return the access control list (ACL) of a bucket. To use ``GET`` to return the ACL of the bucket, you must have ``READ_ACP`` access to the bucket. If ``READ_ACP`` permission is granted to the anonymous user, you can return the ACL of the bucket without using an authorization header.

     

    .. note::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, requests to read ACLs are still supported and return the ``bucket-owner-full-control`` ACL with the owner being the account that created the bucket. For more information, see `Controlling object ownership and disabling ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

  .. py:method:: get_bucket_lifecycle_configuration(**kwargs)

    

    .. note::

       

      Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API. The response describes the new filter element that you can use to specify a filter to select a subset of objects to which the rule applies. If you are using a previous version of the lifecycle configuration, it still works. For the earlier action, see `GetBucketLifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLifecycle.html>`__.

       

     

    Returns the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket. For information about lifecycle configuration, see `Object Lifecycle Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission, by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others.

  .. py:method:: get_bucket_replication(**kwargs)

    

    Returns the replication configuration of a bucket.

     

    .. note::

       

      It can take a while to propagate the put or delete a replication configuration to all Amazon S3 systems. Therefore, a get request soon after put or delete can return a wrong result.

              - **Priority** *(integer) --* 

                The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority.

    Returns the tag set associated with the bucket.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:GetBucketTagging`` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant this permission to others.

     

     ``GetBucketTagging`` has the following special error:

     

     
    * Error code: ``NoSuchTagSet``   

       
      * Description: There is no tag set associated with the bucket.

          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: get_object(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use ``GET`` , you must have ``READ`` access to the object. If you grant ``READ`` access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header.

     

    An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object ``sample.jpg`` , you can name it ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` .

     

    To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the ``GET`` operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` , specify the resource as ``/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For a path-style request example, if you have the object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` in the bucket named ``examplebucket`` , specify the resource as ``/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For more information about request types, see `HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket>`__.

     

    For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see `GetObjectAcl <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html>`__.

     

    If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__. Otherwise, this action returns an ``InvalidObjectStateError`` error. For information about restoring archived objects, see `Restoring Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__.

     

    Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

     

    If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:

     

     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 
     

     

    For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__.

     

    Assuming you have the relevant permission to read object tags, the response also returns the ``x-amz-tagging-count`` header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use `GetObjectTagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTagging.html>`__ to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission.

     

     
    * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error. 
     
    * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error. 
     

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * If you supply a ``versionId`` , you need the ``s3:GetObjectVersion`` permission to access a specific version of an object. If you request a specific version, you do not need to have the ``s3:GetObject`` permission.  
       
      * If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes ``x-amz-delete-marker: true`` in the response. 
       

       

     

    For more information about versioning, see `PutBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html>`__. 

     

     **Overriding Response Header Values**  

     

    There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might override the ``Content-Disposition`` response header value in your GET request.

     

    You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are ``Content-Type`` , ``Content-Language`` , ``Expires`` , ``Cache-Control`` , ``Content-Disposition`` , and ``Content-Encoding`` . To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.

     

    .. note::

       

      You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.

       

     

     
    * ``response-content-type``   
     
    * ``response-content-language``   
     
    * ``response-expires``   
     
    * ``response-cache-control``   
     
    * ``response-content-disposition``   
     
    * ``response-content-encoding``   
     

     

     **Additional Considerations about Request Headers**  

     

    If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and; ``If-Unmodified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested. 

     

    If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: ``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and; ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.

     

    For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__.

     

    The following operations are related to ``GetObject`` :

     

     
    * `ListBuckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html>`__

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **Body** (:class:`.StreamingBody`) -- 

          Object data.

          
        

        - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not appear in the response.

          
        

        - **AcceptRanges** *(string) --* 

          Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

          
        

        - **Expiration** *(string) --* 

          If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response includes this header. It includes the ``expiry-date`` and ``rule-id`` key-value pairs providing object expiration information. The value of the ``rule-id`` is URL-encoded.

            - *(string) --* 
      
    
        

        - **RetentionExpirationDate** *(datetime) --* Date on which it will be legal to delete or modify the object. You can only specify this or the Retention-Period header. If both are specified a 400 error will be returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 
        

        - **RetentionLegalHoldCount** *(integer) --* Returns the count of legal holds on the object. If there are no legal holds, the header is not returned
        

        - **RetentionPeriod** *(integer) --* Retention period to store on the object in seconds. If this field and Retention-Expiration-Date are specified a 400 error is returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 0 is a legal value assuming the bucket's minimum retention period is also 0.
        

        - **SSECustomerAlgorithm** *(string) --* 

          If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

          
        

        - **SSECustomerKeyMD5** *(string) --*

          If present, specifies the ID of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) symmetric customer managed key that was used for the object.

          
        

        - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

          Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for all objects except for S3 Standard storage class objects.

          
        

        - **RequestCharged** *(string) --* 

          If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

          
        

        - **ReplicationStatus** *(string) --* 

          Amazon S3 can return this if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or destination in a replication rule.

          
        

        - **PartsCount** *(integer) --* 

          The count of parts this object has. This value is only returned if you specify ``partNumber`` in your request and the object was uploaded as a multipart upload.

          
        

        - **TagCount** *(integer) --* 

          The number of tags, if any, on the object.

          The date and time when this object's Object Lock will expire.

          
        

        - **ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus** *(string) --* 

          Indicates whether this object has an active legal hold. This field is only returned if you have permission to view an object's legal hold status. 

          
        

        - **IbmRestoredCopyStorageClass** *(string) --* This header is only included if an object has transition metadata. This header will indicate the transition storage class and time of transition. If this header and the x-amz-restore header are both included, this header will indicate the time at which the object was originally archived.
        

        - **IbmTransition** *(string) --* This header is only included if an object has transition metadata. This header will indicate the transition storage class and time of transition. If this header and the x-amz-restore header are both included, this header will indicate the time at which the object was originally archived.

  .. py:method:: get_object_acl(**kwargs)

    

    Returns the access control list (ACL) of an object. To use this operation, you must have ``s3:GetObjectAcl`` permissions or ``READ_ACP`` access to the object. For more information, see `Mapping of ACL permissions and access policy permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#acl-access-policy-permission-mapping>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*  

     

    This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    By default, GET returns ACL information about the current version of an object. To return ACL information about a different version, use the versionId subresource.

     

    .. note::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, requests to read ACLs are still supported and return the ``bucket-owner-full-control`` ACL with the owner being the account that created the bucket. For more information, see `Controlling object ownership and disabling ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

     

    The following operations are related to ``GetObjectAcl`` :

     

     
    * `GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html>`__

  .. py:method:: get_object_tagging(**kwargs)

    

    Returns the tag-set of an object. You send the GET request against the tagging subresource associated with the object.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:GetObjectTagging`` action. By default, the GET action returns information about current version of an object. For a versioned bucket, you can have multiple versions of an object in your bucket. To retrieve tags of any other version, use the versionId query parameter. You also need permission for the ``s3:GetObjectVersionTagging`` action.

     

    By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant this permission to others.

     

    For information about the Amazon S3 object tagging feature, see `Object Tagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-tagging.html>`__.

  .. py:method:: get_public_access_block(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves the ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have the ``s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock`` permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__.

     

    .. warning::

       

      When Amazon S3 evaluates the ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration for a bucket or an object, it checks the ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account. If the ``PublicAccessBlock`` settings are different between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level settings.

       

     

    For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an object public, see `The Meaning of "Public" <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status>`__.

            Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes the following behavior:

          - **IgnorePublicAcls** *(boolean) --* 

            Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on this bucket and objects in this bucket.

             

            Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

  .. py:method:: head_bucket(**kwargs)

    

    This action is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have permission to access it. The action returns a ``200 OK`` if the bucket exists and you have permission to access it.

     

    If the bucket does not exist or you do not have permission to access it, the ``HEAD`` request returns a generic ``404 Not Found`` or ``403 Forbidden`` code. A message body is not included, so you cannot determine the exception beyond these error codes.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:ListBucket`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

     

    To use this API against an access point, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the ARN in place of the bucket name.

  .. py:method:: head_object(**kwargs)

    

    The HEAD action retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This action is useful if you're only interested in an object's metadata. To use HEAD, you must have READ access to the object.

     

    A ``HEAD`` request has the same options as a ``GET`` action on an object. The response is identical to the ``GET`` response except that there is no response body. Because of this, if the ``HEAD`` request generates an error, it returns a generic ``404 Not Found`` or ``403 Forbidden`` code. It is not possible to retrieve the exact exception beyond these error codes.

     

    If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers:

     

     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

    For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error. 
       
      * The last modified property in this case is the creation date of the object. 
       

       

     

    Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see `Common Request Headers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html>`__.

     

    Consider the following when using request headers:

     

     
    * Consideration 1 – If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: 

       
      * ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and; 
       
      * ``If-Unmodified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ; 
       

     

    Then Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` and the data requested.

     
     
    * Consideration 2 – If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: 

       
      * ``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and; 
       
      * ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; 
       

     

    Then Amazon S3 returns the ``304 Not Modified`` response code.

     
     

     

    For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__.

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.

     

     
    * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error. 
     
    * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error. 
     

     

    The following actions are related to ``HeadObject`` :

     

     
    * `GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html>`__   
     
    * `GetObjectAttributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAttributes.html>`__

    :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the bucket containing the object.

       

      When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName* -*AccountId* .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

      When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ``AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

      

    
    :type IfMatch: string
    :param IfMatch: 

      Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same as the one specified; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.

      

    
    :type IfModifiedSince: datetime
    :param IfModifiedSince: 

      Return the object only if it has been modified since the specified time; otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.

      

    
    :type IfNoneMatch: string
    :param IfNoneMatch: 

      Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from the one specified; otherwise, return a 304 (not modified) error.

      

    
    :type IfUnmodifiedSince: datetime
    :param IfUnmodifiedSince: 

      Return the object only if it has not been modified since the specified time; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.

      

    
    :type Key: string
    :param Key: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The object key.

      

    
    :type MirrorDestination: string
    :param MirrorDestination: Mirror source for object reads.

    
    :type Range: string
    :param Range: 

      Because ``HeadObject`` returns only the metadata for an object, this parameter has no effect.

      

    
    :type VersionId: string
    :param VersionId: 

      VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

      

    
    :type SSECustomerAlgorithm: string
    :param SSECustomerAlgorithm: 

      Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).

      

    
    :type SSECustomerKey: string
    :param SSECustomerKey: 

      Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`` header.

      

    
    :type SSECustomerKeyMD5: string
    :param SSECustomerKeyMD5: 

      Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

            Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided. Including this parameter is not required



    
    :type RequestPayer: string
    :param RequestPayer: Ignored by COS if present.

    
    :type PartNumber: integer
    :param PartNumber: 

      Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' HEAD request for the part specified. Useful querying about the size of the part and the number of parts in this object.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not appear in the response.

          
        

        - **AcceptRanges** *(string) --* 

          Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

          
        

        - **Expiration** *(string) --* 

          If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response includes this header. It includes the ``expiry-date`` and ``rule-id`` key-value pairs providing object expiration information. The value of the ``rule-id`` is URL-encoded.

          
        

        - **Restore** *(string) --* 

          If the object is an archived object (an object whose storage class is GLACIER), the response includes this header if either the archive restoration is in progress (see `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__ or an archive copy is already restored.

           

          If an archive copy is already restored, the header value indicates when Amazon S3 is scheduled to delete the object copy. For example:

           

           ``x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Fri, 21 Dec 2012 00:00:00 GMT"``  

           

          If the object restoration is in progress, the header returns the value ``ongoing-request="true"`` .

           

          For more information about archiving objects, see `Transitioning Objects\: General Considerations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-transition-general-considerations>`__.

          
        

        - **LastModified** *(datetime) --* 

          Creation date of the object.

          
        

        - **ContentLength** *(integer) --* 

          Size of the body in bytes.

          
        

        - **ETag** *(string) --* 

          An entity tag (ETag) is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.

          
        

        - **MissingMeta** *(integer) --* 

          This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in ``x-amz-meta`` headers. This can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more flexible metadata than the REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose values are not legal HTTP headers.

          
        

        - **VersionId** *(string) --* 

          Version of the object.

          
        

        - **CacheControl** *(string) --* 

          Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.

          
        

        - **ContentDisposition** *(string) --* 

          Specifies presentational information for the object.

          
        

        - **ContentEncoding** *(string) --* 

          Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

          
        

        - **ContentLanguage** *(string) --* 

          The language the content is in.

          
        

        - **ContentType** *(string) --* 

          A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

          
        

        - **Expires** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

          
        

        - **WebsiteRedirectLocation** *(string) --* 

          If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata.

          
        

        - **ServerSideEncryption** *(string) --* 

          If the object is stored using server-side encryption either with an Amazon Web Services KMS key or an Amazon S3-managed encryption key, the response includes this header with the value of the server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

          
        

        - **Metadata** *(dict) --* 

          A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
            

            - *(string) --* 
      
    
        

        - **RetentionExpirationDate** *(datetime) --* Date on which it will be legal to delete or modify the object. You can only specify this or the Retention-Period header. If both are specified a 400 error will be returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 
        

        - **RetentionLegalHoldCount** *(integer) --* Returns the count of legal holds on the object. If there are no legal holds, the header is not returned
        

        - **RetentionPeriod** *(integer) --* Retention period to store on the object in seconds. If this field and Retention-Expiration-Date are specified a 400 error is returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 0 is a legal value assuming the bucket's minimum retention period is also 0.
        

        - **SSECustomerAlgorithm** *(string) --* 

          If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

          
        

        - **SSECustomerKeyMD5** *(string) --* 

          If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will include this header to provide round-trip message integrity verification of the customer-provided encryption key.

          
        

        - **SSEKMSKeyId** *(string) --* 

          If present, specifies the ID of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) symmetric customer managed key that was used for the object.

          
        

        - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

          Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for all objects except for S3 Standard storage class objects.

           

          For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__.

          
        

        - **RequestCharged** *(string) --* 

          If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

          
        

        - **ReplicationStatus** *(string) --* 

          Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or a destination in a replication rule.

           

          In replication, you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and destination bucket or buckets where Amazon S3 stores object replicas. When you request an object ( ``GetObject`` ) or object metadata ( ``HeadObject`` ) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header in the response as follows:

           

           
          * **If requesting an object from the source bucket** , Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header if the object in your request is eligible for replication. For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify object prefix ``TaxDocs`` requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix ``TaxDocs`` . Any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example ``TaxDocs/document1.pdf`` , are eligible for replication. For any object request with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating object replication status. 
           
          * **If requesting an object from a destination bucket** , Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header with value REPLICA if the object in your request is a replica that Amazon S3 created and there is no replica modification replication in progress. 
           
          * **When replicating objects to multiple destination buckets** , the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header acts differently. The header of the source object will only return a value of COMPLETED when replication is successful to all destinations. The header will remain at value PENDING until replication has completed for all destinations. If one or more destinations fails replication the header will return FAILED.  
           

           

          For more information, see `Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__.

          
        

        - **PartsCount** *(integer) --* 

          The count of parts this object has. This value is only returned if you specify ``partNumber`` in your request and the object was uploaded as a multipart upload.

          
        

        - **ObjectLockMode** *(string) --* 

          The Object Lock mode, if any, that's in effect for this object. This header is only returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectRetention`` permission. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see `Object Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html>`__. 

          
        

        - **ObjectLockRetainUntilDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time when the Object Lock retention period expires. This header is only returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectRetention`` permission.

          
        

        - **ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus** *(string) --* 

          Specifies whether a legal hold is in effect for this object. This header is only returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectLegalHold`` permission. This header is not returned if the specified version of this object has never had a legal hold applied. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see `Object Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html>`__.

          
        

        - **IbmRestoredCopyStorageClass** *(string) --* This header is only included if an object has transition metadata. This header will indicate the transition storage class and time of transition. If this header and the x-amz-restore header are both included, this header will indicate the time at which the object was originally archived.
        

        - **IbmTransition** *(string) --* This header is only included if an object has transition metadata. This header will indicate the transition storage class and time of transition. If this header and the x-amz-restore header are both included, this header will indicate the time at which the object was originally archived.

  .. py:method:: list_bucket_analytics_configurations(**kwargs)

    

    Lists the analytics configurations for the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 analytics configurations per bucket.

     

    This action supports list pagination and does not return more than 100 configurations at a time. You should always check the ``IsTruncated`` element in the response. If there are no more configurations to list, ``IsTruncated`` is set to false. If there are more configurations to list, ``IsTruncated`` is set to true, and there will be a value in ``NextContinuationToken`` . You use the ``NextContinuationToken`` value to continue the pagination of the list by passing the value in continuation-token in the request to ``GET`` the next page.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:GetAnalyticsConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default.

  .. py:method:: list_bucket_inventory_configurations(**kwargs)

    

    Returns a list of inventory configurations for the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 analytics configurations per bucket.

     

    This action supports list pagination and does not return more than 100 configurations at a time. Always check the ``IsTruncated`` element in the response. If there are no more configurations to list, ``IsTruncated`` is set to false. If there are more configurations to list, ``IsTruncated`` is set to true, and there is a value in ``NextContinuationToken`` . You use the ``NextContinuationToken`` value to continue the pagination of the list by passing the value in continuation-token in the request to ``GET`` the next page.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:GetInventoryConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others.

                Specifies how frequently inventory results are produced.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          Tells whether the returned list of inventory configurations is complete. A value of true indicates that the list is not complete and the NextContinuationToken is provided for a subsequent request.

          
        

        - **NextContinuationToken** *(string) --* 

          The marker used to continue this inventory configuration listing. Use the ``NextContinuationToken`` from this response to continue the listing in a subsequent request. The continuation token is an opaque value that Amazon S3 understands.

          
    

  .. py:method:: list_bucket_metrics_configurations(**kwargs)

    

    Lists the metrics configurations for the bucket. The metrics configurations are only for the request metrics of the bucket and do not provide information on daily storage metrics. You can have up to 1,000 configurations per bucket.

     

    This action supports list pagination and does not return more than 100 configurations at a time. Always check the ``IsTruncated`` element in the response. If there are no more configurations to list, ``IsTruncated`` is set to false. If there are more configurations to list, ``IsTruncated`` is set to true, and there is a value in ``NextContinuationToken`` . You use the ``NextContinuationToken`` value to continue the pagination of the list by passing the value in ``continuation-token`` in the request to ``GET`` the next page.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:GetMetricsConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

  .. py:method:: list_multipart_uploads(**kwargs)

    

    This action lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated using the Initiate Multipart Upload request, but has not yet been completed or aborted.

     

    This action returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads in the response. 1,000 multipart uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response can include, which is also the default value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the ``max-uploads`` parameter in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the list criteria, the response will contain an ``IsTruncated`` element with the value true. To list the additional multipart uploads, use the ``key-marker`` and ``upload-id-marker`` request parameters.

     

    In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object key, then uploads in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, uploads are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload initiation time.

     

    For more information on multipart uploads, see `Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html>`__.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.list_multipart_uploads(
          Bucket='string',
          Delimiter='string',
          EncodingType='url',
          KeyMarker='string',
          MaxUploads=123,
          MirrorDestination='string',
          Prefix='string',
          UploadIdMarker='string',
          ExpectedBucketOwner='string'
      )
    :type Bucket: string
    :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated. 

       

      When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName* -*AccountId* .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

      When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ``AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

      

    
    :type Delimiter: string
    :param Delimiter: 

      Character you use to group keys.

       

      All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if specified, and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are grouped under a single result element, ``CommonPrefixes`` . If you don't specify the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at the beginning of the key. The keys that are grouped under ``CommonPrefixes`` result element are not returned elsewhere in the response.

      

    
    :type EncodingType: string
    :param EncodingType: 

      Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and specifies the encoding method to use. An object key may contain any Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

      

    
    :type KeyMarker: string
    :param KeyMarker: 

      Together with upload-id-marker, this parameter specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin.

       

      If ``upload-id-marker`` is not specified, only the keys lexicographically greater than the specified ``key-marker`` will be included in the list.

       

      If ``upload-id-marker`` is specified, any multipart uploads for a key equal to the ``key-marker`` might also be included, provided those multipart uploads have upload IDs lexicographically greater than the specified ``upload-id-marker`` .

      

    
    :type MaxUploads: integer
    :param MaxUploads: 

      Sets the maximum number of multipart uploads, from 1 to 1,000, to return in the response body. 1,000 is the maximum number of uploads that can be returned in a response.

      

    
    :type MirrorDestination: string
    :param MirrorDestination: Mirror source for object reads.

    
    :type Prefix: string
    :param Prefix: 

      Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different grouping of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)

      

    
    :type UploadIdMarker: string
    :param UploadIdMarker: 

      Together with key-marker, specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin. If key-marker is not specified, the upload-id-marker parameter is ignored. Otherwise, any multipart uploads for a key equal to the key-marker might be included in the list only if they have an upload ID lexicographically greater than the specified ``upload-id-marker`` .

      

    
    :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
    :param ExpectedBucketOwner: Ignored by COS if present.

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.list_object_versions(
          Bucket='string',
          Delimiter='string',
          EncodingType='url',
          KeyMarker='string',
          MaxKeys=123,
          Prefix='string',
          VersionIdMarker='string',
          ExpectedBucketOwner='string'
      )
    :type Bucket: string
    :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The bucket name that contains the objects. 

       

      When using this API with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName* -*AccountId* .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this operation using an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using Access Points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide* .

      

    
    :type Delimiter: string
    :param Delimiter: 

      A delimiter is a character that you specify to group keys. All keys that contain the same string between the ``prefix`` and the first occurrence of the delimiter are grouped under a single result element in CommonPrefixes. These groups are counted as one result against the max-keys limitation. These keys are not returned elsewhere in the response.

      

    
    :type EncodingType: string
    :param EncodingType: 

      Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and specifies the encoding method to use. An object key may contain any Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

      

    
    :type KeyMarker: string
    :param KeyMarker: 

      Specifies the key to start with when listing objects in a bucket.

      

    
    :type MaxKeys: integer
    :param MaxKeys: 

      Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more. If additional keys satisfy the search criteria, but were not returned because max-keys was exceeded, the response contains <isTruncated>true</isTruncated>. To return the additional keys, see key-marker and version-id-marker.

      

    
    :type Prefix: string
    :param Prefix: 

      Use this parameter to select only those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different groupings of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.) You can use prefix with delimiter to roll up numerous objects into a single result under CommonPrefixes. 

      

    
    :type VersionIdMarker: string
    :param VersionIdMarker: 

      Specifies the object version you want to start listing from.

      

    
    :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
    :param ExpectedBucketOwner: Ignored by COS if present.

            Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix is notes/summer/. 

            
            

            - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

              Container for the specified common prefix.

              
        
      
        

        - **EncodingType** *(string) --* 

          Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object key names in the XML response.

           

          If you specify encoding-type request parameter, Amazon S3 includes this element in the response, and returns encoded key name values in the following response elements:

           

           ``KeyMarker, NextKeyMarker, Prefix, Key`` , and ``Delimiter`` .

          
    

    **Examples** 

    The following example return versions of an object with specific key name prefix. The request limits the number of items returned to two. If there are are more than two object version, S3 returns NextToken in the response. You can specify this token value in your next request to fetch next set of object versions.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether Amazon S3 returned all of the results that satisfied the search criteria.

          
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          Indicates where in the bucket listing begins. Marker is included in the response if it was sent with the request.

          
        

        - **NextMarker** *(string) --* 

          When response is truncated (the IsTruncated element value in the response is true), you can use the key name in this field as marker in the subsequent request to get next set of objects. Amazon S3 lists objects in alphabetical order Note: This element is returned only if you have delimiter request parameter specified. If response does not include the NextMarker and it is truncated, you can use the value of the last Key in the response as the marker in the subsequent request to get the next set of object keys.

          
        

        - **Contents** *(list) --* 

          Metadata about each object returned.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key to retrieve the object.

              
            

            - **LastModified** *(datetime) --* 

              Creation date of the object.

              
            

            - **ETag** *(string) --* 

              The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects changes only to the contents of an object, not its metadata. The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object data. Whether or not it is depends on how the object was created and how it is encrypted as described below:

               

               
              * Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have ETags that are an MD5 digest of their object data. 
               
              * Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags that are not an MD5 digest of their object data. 
               
              * If an object is created by either the Multipart Upload or Part Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regardless of the method of encryption. 
               

              
            

            - **Size** *(integer) --* 

              Size in bytes of the object

              
            

            - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

              The class of storage used to store the object.

              
            

            - **Owner** *(dict) --* 

              The owner of the object

              
              

              - **DisplayName** *(string) --* 

                Container for the display name of the owner.

                
              

              - **ID** *(string) --* 

                Container for the ID of the owner.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The bucket name.

          
        

        - **IBMSSEKPEnabled** *(boolean) --* The bucket encryption enabled or not.
        

        - **IBMSSEKPCrkId** *(string) --* CRK ID of the Bucket encryption
        

        - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

          Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

          
        

        - **Delimiter** *(string) --* 

          Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single result element in the ``CommonPrefixes`` collection. These rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the response. Each rolled-up result counts as only one return against the ``MaxKeys`` value.

          
        

        - **MaxKeys** *(integer) --* 

          The maximum number of keys returned in the response body.

          
        

        - **CommonPrefixes** *(list) --* 

          All of the keys (up to 1,000) rolled up in a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns. 

           

          A response can contain CommonPrefixes only if you specify a delimiter.

           

          CommonPrefixes contains all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of the string specified by the delimiter.

           

          CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix.

           

          For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix is notes/summer/. All of the keys that roll up into a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix is notes/summer/. 

            
            

            - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

              Container for the specified common prefix.

              
        
      
        

        - **EncodingType** *(string) --* 

          Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object keys in the response.

  .. py:method:: list_objects_v2(**kwargs)

    

    Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket with each request. You can use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a bucket. A ``200 OK`` response can contain valid or invalid XML. Make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. Objects are returned sorted in an ascending order of the respective key names in the list. For more information about listing objects, see `Listing object keys programmatically <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ListingKeysUsingAPIs.html>`__  

     

    To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket.

For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

           

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ``AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

          
        

        - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

          Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

          
        

        - **Delimiter** *(string) --* 

          Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single result element in the CommonPrefixes collection. These rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the response. Each rolled-up result counts as only one return against the ``MaxKeys`` value.

          
        

        - **MaxKeys** *(integer) --* 

          Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more.

          
        

        - **CommonPrefixes** *(list) --* 

          All of the keys (up to 1,000) rolled up into a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns.

           

          A response can contain ``CommonPrefixes`` only if you specify a delimiter.

           

           ``CommonPrefixes`` contains all (if there are any) keys between ``Prefix`` and the next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter.

           

           ``CommonPrefixes`` lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by ``Prefix`` .

           

          For example, if the prefix is ``notes/`` and the delimiter is a slash ( ``/`` ) as in ``notes/summer/july`` , the common prefix is ``notes/summer/`` . All of the keys that roll up into a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns. 

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix is notes/summer/. 

            
            

            - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

              Container for the specified common prefix.

              
        
      
        

        - **EncodingType** *(string) --* 

          Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object key names in the XML response.

           

          If you specify the encoding-type request parameter, Amazon S3 includes this element in the response, and returns encoded key name values in the following response elements:

           

           ``Delimiter, Prefix, Key,`` and ``StartAfter`` .

          
        

        - **KeyCount** *(integer) --* 

          KeyCount is the number of keys returned with this request. KeyCount will always be less than or equals to MaxKeys field. Say you ask for 50 keys, your result will include less than equals 50 keys 

          
        

        - **ContinuationToken** *(string) --* 

          If ContinuationToken was sent with the request, it is included in the response.

          
        

        - **NextContinuationToken** *(string) --* 

           ``NextContinuationToken`` is sent when ``isTruncated`` is true, which means there are more keys in the bucket that can be listed. The next list requests to Amazon S3 can be continued with this ``NextContinuationToken`` . ``NextContinuationToken`` is obfuscated and is not a real key

          
        

        - **StartAfter** *(string) --* 

          If StartAfter was sent with the request, it is included in the response.

          
    
    **Exceptions** 
    
    *     :py:class:`S3.Client.exceptions.NoSuchBucket`

    

    **Examples** 

    The following example retrieves object list. The request specifies max keys to limit response to include only 2 object keys.

  .. py:method:: list_parts(**kwargs)

    

    Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload. This operation must include the upload ID, which you obtain by sending the initiate multipart upload request (see `CreateMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html>`__ ). This request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The default number of parts returned is 1,000 parts. You can restrict the number of parts returned by specifying the ``max-parts`` request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an ``IsTruncated`` field with the value of true, and a ``NextPartNumberMarker`` element. In subsequent ``ListParts`` requests you can include the part-number-marker query string parameter and set its value to the ``NextPartNumberMarker`` field value from the previous response.

  .. py:method:: put_bucket_accelerate_configuration(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the accelerate configuration of an existing bucket. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers to Amazon S3.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:PutAccelerateConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

     

    The Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket can be set to one of the following two values:

     

     
    * Enabled – Enables accelerated data transfers to the bucket. 
     
    * Suspended – Disables accelerated data transfers to the bucket. 
     

     

    The `GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html>`__ action returns the transfer acceleration state of a bucket.

     

    After setting the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket to Enabled, it might take up to thirty minutes before the data transfer rates to the bucket increase.

  .. py:method:: put_bucket_acl(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL). For more information, see `Using ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have ``WRITE_ACP`` permission.

     

    You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:

     

     
    * Specify the ACL in the request body 
     
    * Specify permissions using request headers 
     

     

    .. note::

       

      You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.

       

     

    Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the ``AccessControlListNotSupported`` error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see `Controlling object ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

     

     **Access Permissions**  

     

    You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of ``x-amz-acl`` . If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the ``x-amz-acl`` header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: 

       
      * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account 
       
      * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group 
       
      * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account 

      .. note::

         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

           
          * US East (N. Virginia) 
           
          * US West (N. California) 
           
          * US West (Oregon) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
           
          * Europe (Ireland) 
           
          * South America (São Paulo) 
           

         

        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

         

       
       

     

    For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-write`` header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.

     

     ``x-amz-grant-write: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery", id="111122223333", id="555566667777"``  

     
     

     

    You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.

     

     **Grantee Values**  

     

    You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:

     

     
    * By the person's ID:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>``   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request 
     
    * By URI:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>``   
     
    * By Email address:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>``   The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.  

    .. note::

       Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

         
        * US East (N. Virginia) 
         
        * US West (N. California) 
         
        * US West (Oregon) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
         
        * Europe (Ireland) 
         
        * South America (São Paulo)

    **Examples** 

    The following example replaces existing ACL on a bucket. The ACL grants the bucket owner (specified using the owner ID) and write permission to the LogDelivery group. Because this is a replace operation, you must specify all the grants in your request. To incrementally add or remove ACL grants, you might use the console.

  .. py:method:: put_bucket_analytics_configuration(**kwargs)

    

    Sets an analytics configuration for the bucket (specified by the analytics configuration ID). You can have up to 1,000 analytics configurations per bucket.

     

    You can choose to have storage class analysis export analysis reports sent to a comma-separated values (CSV) flat file. See the ``DataExport`` request element. Reports are updated daily and are based on the object filters that you configure. When selecting data export, you specify a destination bucket and an optional destination prefix where the file is written. You can export the data to a destination bucket in a different account. However, the destination bucket must be in the same Region as the bucket that you are making the PUT analytics configuration to. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Analytics – Storage Class Analysis <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/analytics-storage-class.html>`__. 

     

    .. warning::

       

      You must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket where the exported file is written to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket. For an example policy, see `Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-9>`__.

       

     

    To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:PutAnalyticsConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

  .. py:method:: put_bucket_cors(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the ``cors`` configuration for your bucket. If the configuration exists, Amazon S3 replaces it.

     

    To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the ``s3:PutBucketCORS`` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.

     

    You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is ``http://www.example.com`` to access your Amazon S3 bucket at ``my.example.bucket.com`` by using the browser's ``XMLHttpRequest`` capability.

     

    To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the ``cors`` subresource to the bucket. The ``cors`` subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size. 

     

    When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the ``cors`` configuration on the bucket and uses the first ``CORSRule`` rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:

     

     
    * The request's ``Origin`` header must match ``AllowedOrigin`` elements. 
     
    * The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the ``Access-Control-Request-Method`` header in case of a pre-flight ``OPTIONS`` request must be one of the ``AllowedMethod`` elements.  
     
    * Every header specified in the ``Access-Control-Request-Headers`` request header of a pre-flight request must match an ``AllowedHeader`` element.

  .. py:method:: put_bucket_inventory_configuration(**kwargs)

    

    This implementation of the ``PUT`` action adds an inventory configuration (identified by the inventory ID) to the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 inventory configurations per bucket. 

     

    Amazon S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket on a daily or weekly basis, and the results are published to a flat file. The bucket that is inventoried is called the *source* bucket, and the bucket where the inventory flat file is stored is called the *destination* bucket. The *destination* bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the *source* bucket. 

     

    When you configure an inventory for a *source* bucket, you specify the *destination* bucket where you want the inventory to be stored, and whether to generate the inventory daily or weekly. You can also configure what object metadata to include and whether to inventory all object versions or only current versions. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Inventory <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html>`__ in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

     

    .. warning::

       

      You must create a bucket policy on the *destination* bucket to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket in the defined location. For an example policy, see `Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-9>`__.

       

     

    To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:PutInventoryConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__ in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

  .. py:method:: put_bucket_lifecycle_configuration(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an existing lifecycle configuration. Keep in mind that this will overwrite an existing lifecycle configuration, so if you want to retain any configuration details, they must be included in the new lifecycle configuration. For information about lifecycle configuration, see `Managing your storage lifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

      Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API. The previous version of the API supported filtering based only on an object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compatibility. For the related API description, see `PutBucketLifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html>`__.

       

     

     **Rules**  

     

    You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The lifecycle configuration is specified as XML consisting of one or more rules. Each rule consists of the following:

     

     
    * Filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies. The filter can be based on a key name prefix, object tags, or a combination of both. 
     
    * Status whether the rule is in effect. 
     
    * One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you want Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter. If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object (one current version and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined actions that you can specify for current and noncurrent object versions. 
     

     

    For more information, see `Object Lifecycle Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ and `Lifecycle Configuration Elements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html>`__.

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration). Only the resource owner (that is, the Amazon Web Services account that created it) can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, a user must get the ``s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`` permission.

     

    You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also supersedes any other permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:

     

     
    * ``s3:DeleteObject``   
     
    * ``s3:DeleteObjectVersion``   
     
    * ``s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration``   
     

     

    For more information about permissions, see `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

  .. py:method:: put_bucket_metrics_configuration(**kwargs)

    

    Sets a metrics configuration (specified by the metrics configuration ID) for the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 metrics configurations per bucket. If you're updating an existing metrics configuration, note that this is a full replacement of the existing metrics configuration. If you don't include the elements you want to keep, they are erased.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:PutMetricsConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others.

  .. py:method:: put_bucket_replication(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For more information, see `Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and other relevant information.

     

    A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.

     

    To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` , ``Status`` , and ``Priority`` .

     

    .. note::

       

      If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see `Backward Compatibility <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations>`__.

       

     

    For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see `Using Versioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html>`__.

     

     **Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects**  

     

    By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using server-side encryption with KMS keys. To replicate Amazon Web Services KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: ``SourceSelectionCriteria`` , ``SseKmsEncryptedObjects`` , ``Status`` , ``EncryptionConfiguration`` , and ``ReplicaKmsKeyID`` . For information about replication configuration, see `Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html>`__.

     

    For information on ``PutBucketReplication`` errors, see `List of replication-related error codes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList>`__  

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    To create a ``PutBucketReplication`` request, you must have ``s3:PutReplicationConfiguration`` permissions for the bucket. 

     

    By default, a resource owner, in this case the Amazon Web Services account that created the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the operation. For more information about permissions, see `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

      To perform this operation, the user or role performing the action must have the `iam\:PassRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html>`__ permission.

  .. py:method:: put_bucket_tagging(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the tags for a bucket.

     

    Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see `Cost Allocation and Tagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html>`__ and `Using Cost Allocation in Amazon S3 Bucket Tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CostAllocTagging.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

      When this operation sets the tags for a bucket, it will overwrite any current tags the bucket already has. You cannot use this operation to add tags to an existing list of tags.

       

     

    To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:PutBucketTagging`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

      }

    

  .. py:method:: put_bucket_versioning(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the versioning state of an existing bucket.

     

    You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:

     

     **Enabled** —Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

     

     **Suspended** —Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

     

    If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no versioning state; a `GetBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html>`__ request does not return a versioning state value.

     

    In order to enable MFA Delete, you must be the bucket owner. If you are the bucket owner and want to enable MFA Delete in the bucket versioning configuration, you must include the ``x-amz-mfa request`` header and the ``Status`` and the ``MfaDelete`` request elements in a request to set the versioning state of the bucket.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.) For more information, see `Lifecycle and Versioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-and-other-bucket-config>`__.

    **Examples** 

    The following example sets versioning configuration on bucket. The configuration enables versioning on the bucket.
    ::

      response = client.put_bucket_versioning(
          Bucket='examplebucket',
          VersioningConfiguration={
              'MFADelete': 'Disabled',
              'Status': 'Enabled',
          },
      )
      
      print(response)

      {
          'ResponseMetadata': {
              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: put_bucket_website(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the configuration of the website that is specified in the ``website`` subresource. To configure a bucket as a website, you can add this subresource on the bucket with website configuration information such as the file name of the index document and any redirect rules. For more information, see `Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html>`__.

     

    This PUT action requires the ``S3:PutBucketWebsite`` permission. By default, only the bucket owner can configure the website attached to a bucket; however, bucket owners can allow other users to set the website configuration by writing a bucket policy that grants them the ``S3:PutBucketWebsite`` permission.

     

    To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint, you add a website configuration with the following elements. Because all requests are sent to another website, you don't need to provide index document name for the bucket.

     

     
    * ``WebsiteConfiguration``   
     
    * ``RedirectAllRequestsTo``   
     
    * ``HostName``   
     
    * ``Protocol``   
     

     

    If you want granular control over redirects, you can use the following elements to add routing rules that describe conditions for redirecting requests and information about the redirect destination. In this case, the website configuration must provide an index document for the bucket, because some requests might not be redirected. 

     

     
    * ``WebsiteConfiguration``   
     
    * ``IndexDocument``   
     
    * ``Suffix``   
     
    * ``ErrorDocument``   
     
    * ``Key``   
     
    * ``RoutingRules``   
     
    * ``RoutingRule``   
     
    * ``Condition``   
     
    * ``HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals``   
     
    * ``KeyPrefixEquals``   
     
    * ``Redirect``   
     
    * ``Protocol``   
     
    * ``HostName``   
     
    * ``ReplaceKeyPrefixWith``   
     
    * ``ReplaceKeyWith``   
     
    * ``HttpRedirectCode``   
     

     

    Amazon S3 has a limitation of 50 routing rules per website configuration. If you require more than 50 routing rules, you can use object redirect. For more information, see `Configuring an Object Redirect <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

      }

    

  .. py:method:: put_object(**kwargs)

    

    Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.

     

    Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.

     

    Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead.

     

    To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the ``Content-MD5`` header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * To successfully complete the ``PutObject`` request, you must have the ``s3:PutObject`` in your IAM permissions. 
       
      * To successfully change the objects acl of your ``PutObject`` request, you must have the ``s3:PutObjectAcl`` in your IAM permissions. 
       
      * The ``Content-MD5`` header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see `Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .  
       

       

     

     **Server-side Encryption**  

     

    You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see `Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__.

     

    If you request server-side encryption using Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Bucket Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers**  

     

    You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ and `Managing ACLs Using the REST API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html>`__. 

     

    If the bucket that you're uploading objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the ``bucket-owner-full-control`` canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return a ``400`` error with the error code ``AccessControlListNotSupported`` .

     

    For more information, see `Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.

       

     

     **Storage Class Options**  

     

    By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.

     

    For more information about versioning, see `Adding Objects to Versioning Enabled Buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html>`__. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see `GetBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html>`__.

  .. py:method:: put_object_acl(**kwargs)

    

    Uses the ``acl`` subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for a new or existing object in an S3 bucket. You must have ``WRITE_ACP`` permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see `What permissions can I grant? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#permissions>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

     

    Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    .. warning::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the ``AccessControlListNotSupported`` error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see `Controlling object ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

     

     **Access Permissions**  

     

    You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of ``x-amz-ac`` l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use ``x-amz-acl`` header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: 

       
      * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account 
       
      * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group 
       
      * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account 

      .. note::

         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

           
          * US East (N. Virginia) 
           
          * US West (N. California) 
           
          * US West (Oregon) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
           
          * Europe (Ireland) 
           
          * South America (São Paulo) 
           

         

        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

         

       
       

     

    For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants list objects permission to the two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.

     

     ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``  

     
     

     

    You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.

     

     **Grantee Values**  

     

    You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:

     

     
    * By the person's ID:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>``   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request. 
     
    * By URI:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>``   
     
    * By Email address:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>``   The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser. 

    .. note::

       Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

         
        * US East (N. Virginia) 
         
        * US West (N. California) 
         
        * US West (Oregon) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
         
        * Europe (Ireland) 
         
        * South America (São Paulo) 
         

       

      For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

       

     
     

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets the ACL of the current version of an object. To set the ACL of a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

  .. py:method:: put_object_tagging(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the supplied tag-set to an object that already exists in a bucket.

     

    A tag is a key-value pair. You can associate tags with an object by sending a PUT request against the tagging subresource that is associated with the object. You can retrieve tags by sending a GET request. For more information, see `GetObjectTagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTagging.html>`__.

     

    For tagging-related restrictions related to characters and encodings, see `Tag Restrictions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.html>`__. Note that Amazon S3 limits the maximum number of tags to 10 tags per object.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:PutObjectTagging`` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant this permission to others.

     

    To put tags of any other version, use the ``versionId`` query parameter. You also need permission for the ``s3:PutObjectVersionTagging`` action.

  .. py:method:: put_public_access_block(**kwargs)

    

    Creates or modifies the ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have the ``s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock`` permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__.

     

    .. warning::

       

      When Amazon S3 evaluates the ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration for a bucket or an object, it checks the ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account. If the ``PublicAccessBlock`` configurations are different between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level settings.

       

     

    For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an object public, see `The Meaning of "Public" <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status>`__.

      - **BlockPublicAcls** *(boolean) --* 

        Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes the following behavior:

         

         
        * PUT Bucket ACL and PUT Object ACL calls fail if the specified ACL is public. 
         
        * PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL. 
         
        * PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL. 
         

         

        Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

        

      
      - **IgnorePublicAcls** *(boolean) --* 

        Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on this bucket and objects in this bucket.

         

        Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

  .. py:method:: restore_object(**kwargs)

    

    Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3

     

    This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

     

    This action performs the following types of requests: 

     

     
    * ``select`` - Perform a select query on an archived object 
     
    * ``restore an archive`` - Restore an archived object 
     

     

    To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:RestoreObject`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Querying Archives with Select Requests**  

     

    You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview about select requests, see `Querying Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    When making a select request, do the following:

     

     
    * Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The Amazon Web Services account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see `Querying Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . For more information about the ``S3`` structure in the request body, see the following: 

       
      * `PutObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html>`__   
       
      * `Managing Access with ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*   
       
      * `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*   
       

     
     
    * Define the SQL expression for the ``SELECT`` type of restoration for your query in the request body's ``SelectParameters`` structure. You can use expressions like the following examples. 

       
      * The following expression returns all records from the specified object.  ``SELECT * FROM Object``   
       
      * Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.  ``SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 > 100``   
       
      * If you have headers and you set the ``fileHeaderInfo`` in the ``CSV`` structure in the request body to ``USE`` , you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the ``fileHeaderInfo`` field to ``IGNORE`` , the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names.   ``SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s``   
       

     
     

     

    For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see `SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    When making a select request, you can also do the following:

     

     
    * To expedite your queries, specify the ``Expedited`` tier. For more information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic. 
     
    * Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results. 
     

     

    The following are additional important facts about the select feature:

     

     
    * The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy. 
     
    * You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests. 
     
    * Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response ``409`` . 
     

     

     **Restoring objects**  

     

    Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time. For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.

     

    To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

     

    When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the ``Tier`` element of the request body: 

     

     
    * ``Expedited`` - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. 
     
    * ``Standard`` - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. 
     
    * ``Bulk`` - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. 
     

     

    For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for ``Expedited`` data access, see `Restoring Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see `Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    To get the status of object restoration, you can send a ``HEAD`` request. Operations return the ``x-amz-restore`` header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see `Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.

     

    If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html>`__ and `Object Lifecycle Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ in *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Responses**  

     

    A successful action returns either the ``200 OK`` or ``202 Accepted`` status code. 

     

     
    * If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns ``202 Accepted`` in the response.  
     
    * If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` in the response.  
     

     

     **Special Errors**  

     

     
    *

  .. py:method:: upload_part(**kwargs)

    

    Uploads a part in a multipart upload.

     

    .. note::

       

      In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the `UploadPartCopy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html>`__ operation. 

       

     

    You must initiate a multipart upload (see `CreateMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html>`__ ) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.

     

    Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.

     

    To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the ``Content-MD5`` header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. 

     

    If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the ``x-amz-content-sha256`` header as a checksum instead of ``Content-MD5`` . For more information see `Authenticating Requests\: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html>`__. 

     

     **Note:** After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.

     

    For more information on multipart uploads, go to `Multipart Upload Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to `Multipart Upload and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using `CreateMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html>`__. For more information, go to `Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see `CreateMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html>`__.

     

    If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following headers.

     

     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 
     

     

     **Special Errors**  

     

     
    * 

      
      * *Code: NoSuchUpload*   
       
      * *Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.*   
       
      * *HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found*

    **Examples** 

    The following example uploads part 1 of a multipart upload. The example specifies a file name for the part data. The Upload ID is same that is returned by the initiate multipart upload.
    ::

      response = client.upload_part(
          Body='fileToUpload',
          Bucket='examplebucket',
          Key='examplelargeobject',

      )
      
      print(response)

    
    Expected Output:
    ::

      {
          'ETag': '"d8c2eafd90c266e19ab9dcacc479f8af"',
          'ResponseMetadata': {
              '...': '...',
          },
      }

    

  .. py:method:: upload_part_copy(**kwargs)

    

    Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. You specify the data source by adding the request header ``x-amz-copy-source`` in your request and a byte range by adding the request header ``x-amz-copy-source-range`` in your request. 

     

    The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more information about multipart upload limits, go to `Quick Facts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/qfacts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    .. note::

       

      Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__ action and provide data in your request.

       

     

    You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part request.

     

    For more information about using the ``UploadPartCopy`` operation, see the following:

     

     
    * For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see `Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 
     
    * For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see `Multipart Upload and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 
     
    * For information about copying objects using a single atomic action vs. a multipart upload, see `Operations on Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectOperations.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 
     
    * For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys with the ``UploadPartCopy`` operation, see `CopyObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html>`__ and `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__. 
     

     

    Note the following additional considerations about the request headers ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` , ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` , ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` , and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` :

     

     

     

     
    * **Consideration 1** - If both of the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` headers are present in the request as follows:  ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and;  ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ; Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` and copies the data.  
     
    * **Consideration 2** - If both of the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` headers are present in the request as follows:  ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and;  ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; Amazon S3 returns ``412 Precondition Failed`` response code.  
     

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the ``x-amz-copy-source`` , Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the ``x-amz-copy-source`` and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the ``x-amz-copy-source`` . 

     

    You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the ``versionId`` subresource as shown in the following example:

     

     ``x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id``  

     

     **Special Errors**  

     

     
    * 

      
      * *Code: NoSuchUpload*   
       
      * *Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.*   
       
      * *HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found*   
       

     
     
    * 

      
      * *Code: InvalidRequest*   
       
      * *Cause: The specified copy source is not supported as a byte-range copy source.*   
       
      * *HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request*

    :type Bucket: string
    :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The bucket name.

       

      When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName* -*AccountId* .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

      When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ``AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

      

    
    :type CopySource: str or dict
    :param CopySource: **[REQUIRED]** The name of the source bucket, key name of the source object, and optional version ID of the source object.  You can either provide this value as a string or a dictionary.  The string form is {bucket}/{key} or {bucket}/{key}?versionId={versionId} if you want to copy a specific version.  You can also provide this value as a dictionary.  The dictionary format is recommended over the string format because it is more explicit.  The dictionary format is: {'Bucket': 'bucket', 'Key': 'key', 'VersionId': 'id'}.  Note that the VersionId key is optional and may be omitted. To specify an S3 access point, provide the access point ARN for the ``Bucket`` key in the copy source dictionary. If you want to provide the copy source for an S3 access point as a string instead of a dictionary, the ARN provided must be the full S3 access point object ARN (i.e. {accesspoint_arn}/object/{key})

    
    :type CopySourceIfMatch: string
    :param CopySourceIfMatch: 

      Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.

      

    
    :type CopySourceIfModifiedSince: datetime
    :param CopySourceIfModifiedSince: 

      Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.

      

    
    :type CopySourceIfNoneMatch: string
    :param CopySourceIfNoneMatch: 

      Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the specified ETag.

      

    
    :type CopySourceIfUnmodifiedSince: datetime
    :param CopySourceIfUnmodifiedSince: 

      Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.

      

    
    :type CopySourceRange: string
    :param CopySourceRange: 

      The range of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value must use the form bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the zero-based byte offsets to copy. For example, bytes=0-9 indicates that you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy a range only if the source object is greater than 5 MB.

      

    
    :type Key: string

      The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated. 

       

      When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName* -*AccountId* .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

      When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ``AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

      

    
    :type Delimiter: string
    :param Delimiter: 

      Character you use to group keys.

       

      All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if specified, and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are grouped under a single result element, ``CommonPrefixes`` . If you don't specify the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at the beginning of the key. The keys that are grouped under ``CommonPrefixes`` result element are not returned elsewhere in the response.

      

    
    :type EncodingType: string
    :param EncodingType: 

      Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and specifies the encoding method to use. An object key may contain any Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

      

    
    :type MirrorDestination: string
    :param MirrorDestination: Mirror source for object reads.

    
    :type Prefix: string
    :param Prefix: 

      Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different grouping of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)

      

    
    :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
    :param ExpectedBucketOwner: Ignored by COS if present.

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

      A delimiter is a character that you specify to group keys. All keys that contain the same string between the ``prefix`` and the first occurrence of the delimiter are grouped under a single result element in CommonPrefixes. These groups are counted as one result against the max-keys limitation. These keys are not returned elsewhere in the response.

          Indicates where in the bucket listing begins. Marker is included in the response if it was sent with the request.

          
        

        - **NextMarker** *(string) --* 

          When response is truncated (the IsTruncated element value in the response is true), you can use the key name in this field as marker in the subsequent request to get next set of objects. Amazon S3 lists objects in alphabetical order Note: This element is returned only if you have delimiter request parameter specified. If response does not include the NextMarker and it is truncated, you can use the value of the last Key in the response as the marker in the subsequent request to get the next set of object keys.

          
        

        - **Contents** *(list) --*

            - **ETag** *(string) --* 

              The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects changes only to the contents of an object, not its metadata. The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object data. Whether or not it is depends on how the object was created and how it is encrypted as described below:

               

               
              * Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have ETags that are an MD5 digest of their object data. 
               
              * Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags that are not an MD5 digest of their object data. 
               
              * If an object is created by either the Multipart Upload or Part Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regardless of the method of encryption. 
               

              
            

            - **Size** *(integer) --*

          Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

          
        

        - **Delimiter** *(string) --* 

          Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single result element in the ``CommonPrefixes`` collection. These rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the response. Each rolled-up result counts as only one return against the ``MaxKeys`` value.

          
        

        - **MaxKeys** *(integer) --* 

          The maximum number of keys returned in the response body.

          CommonPrefixes contains all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of the string specified by the delimiter.

           

          CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix.

           

          For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix is notes/summer/. All of the keys that roll up into a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix is notes/summer/. 

            
            

            - **Prefix** *(string) --*

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          Set to false if all of the results were returned. Set to true if more keys are available to return. If the number of results exceeds that specified by MaxKeys, all of the results might not be returned.

          
        

        - **Contents** *(list) --* 

          Metadata about each object returned.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key to retrieve the object.

              
            

            - **LastModified** *(datetime) --* 

              Creation date of the object.

              
            

            - **ETag** *(string) --* 

              The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects changes only to the contents of an object, not its metadata. The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object data. Whether or not it is depends on how the object was created and how it is encrypted as described below:

               

               
              * Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have ETags that are an MD5 digest of their object data. 
               
              * Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags that are not an MD5 digest of their object data. 
               
              * If an object is created by either the Multipart Upload or Part Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regardless of the method of encryption. 
               

              
            

            - **Size** *(integer) --* 

              Size in bytes of the object

              
            

            - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

              The class of storage used to store the object.

              
            

            - **Owner** *(dict) --* 

              The owner of the object

              
              

              - **DisplayName** *(string) --* 

                Container for the display name of the owner.

                
              

              - **ID** *(string) --* 

                Container for the ID of the owner.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The bucket name.

           

          When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName* -*AccountId* .s3-accesspoint.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

           

          When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ``AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`` . When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

          
        

        - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

          Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

          
        

        - **Delimiter** *(string) --* 

          Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single result element in the CommonPrefixes collection. These rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the response. Each rolled-up result counts as only one return against the ``MaxKeys`` value.

          
        

        - **MaxKeys** *(integer) --* 

          Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more.

          
        

        - **CommonPrefixes** *(list) --* 

          All of the keys (up to 1,000) rolled up into a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns.

           

          A response can contain ``CommonPrefixes`` only if you specify a delimiter.

           

           ``CommonPrefixes`` contains all (if there are any) keys between ``Prefix`` and the next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter.

           

           ``CommonPrefixes`` lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by ``Prefix`` .

           

          For example, if the prefix is ``notes/`` and the delimiter is a slash ( ``/`` ) as in ``notes/summer/july`` , the common prefix is ``notes/summer/`` . All of the keys that roll up into a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns. 

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix is notes/summer/. 

            
            

            - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

              Container for the specified common prefix.

              
        
      
        

        - **EncodingType** *(string) --* 

          Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object key names in the XML response.

           

          If you specify the encoding-type request parameter, Amazon S3 includes this element in the response, and returns encoded key name values in the following response elements:

           

           ``Delimiter, Prefix, Key,`` and ``StartAfter`` .

          
        

        - **KeyCount** *(integer) --* 

          KeyCount is the number of keys returned with this request. KeyCount will always be less than or equals to MaxKeys field. Say you ask for 50 keys, your result will include less than equals 50 keys 

          
        

        - **ContinuationToken** *(string) --* 

          If ContinuationToken was sent with the request, it is included in the response.

          
        

        - **StartAfter** *(string) --* 

          If StartAfter was sent with the request, it is included in the response.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.

  .. py:method:: create_bucket(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.

     

    Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket naming restrictions, see `Bucket naming rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html>`__.

     

    If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see `Create Bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html>`__. 

     

    By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see `Accessing a bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

      If you send your create bucket request to the ``s3.amazonaws.com`` endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see `Virtual hosting of buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html>`__.

       

     

     **Access control lists (ACLs)**  

     

    When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally configure the bucket ACL to specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If your CreateBucket request sets bucket owner enforced for S3 Object Ownership and specifies a bucket ACL that provides access to an external Amazon Web Services account, your request fails with a ``400`` error and returns the ``InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership`` error code. For more information, see `Controlling object ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

     

    There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL using the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly using the ``x-amz-grant-read`` , ``x-amz-grant-write`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access control list (ACL) overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html>`__. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: 

       
      * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account 
       
      * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group 
       
      * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account 

      .. note::

         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

           
          * US East (N. Virginia) 
           
          * US West (N. California) 
           
          * US West (Oregon) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
           
          * Europe (Ireland) 
           
          * South America (São Paulo) 
           

         

        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

         

       
       

     

    For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:

     

     ``x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"``  

     
     

     

    .. note::

       

      You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.

       

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    In addition to ``s3:CreateBucket`` , the following permissions are required when your CreateBucket includes specific headers:

     

     
    * **ACLs** - If your ``CreateBucket`` request specifies ACL permissions and the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you specify access permissions explicitly through any other ACL, both ``s3:CreateBucket`` and ``s3:PutBucketAcl`` permissions are needed. If the ACL the ``CreateBucket`` request is private or doesn't specify any ACLs, only ``s3:CreateBucket`` permission is needed.  
     
    * **Object Lock** - If ``ObjectLockEnabledForBucket`` is set to true in your ``CreateBucket`` request, ``s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration`` and ``s3:PutBucketVersioning`` permissions are required. 
     
    * **S3 Object Ownership** - If your CreateBucket request includes the the ``x-amz-object-ownership`` header, ``s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls`` permission is required. 
     

     

    The following operations are related to ``CreateBucket`` :

    :type SourceClient: ibm_botocore or ibm_boto3 Client
    :param SourceClient: The client to be used for operation that
        may happen at the source object. For example, this client is
        used for the head_object that determines the size of the copy.
        If no client is provided, the current client is used as the client
        for the source object.
    
    :type Config: ibm_boto3.s3.transfer.TransferConfig
    :param Config: The transfer configuration to be used when performing the
        copy.


  .. py:method:: create(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.

     

    Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket naming restrictions, see `Bucket naming rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html>`__.

     

    If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see `Create Bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html>`__. 

     

    By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see `Accessing a bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

      If you send your create bucket request to the ``s3.amazonaws.com`` endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect.

    When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally configure the bucket ACL to specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If your CreateBucket request sets bucket owner enforced for S3 Object Ownership and specifies a bucket ACL that provides access to an external Amazon Web Services account, your request fails with a ``400`` error and returns the ``InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership`` error code. For more information, see `Controlling object ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

     

    There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL using the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly using the ``x-amz-grant-read`` , ``x-amz-grant-write`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access control list (ACL) overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html>`__. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: 

       
      * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account 
       
      * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group 
       
      * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account 

      .. note::

         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

           
          * US East (N. Virginia) 
           
          * US West (N. California) 
           
          * US West (Oregon) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
           
          * Europe (Ireland) 
           
          * South America (São Paulo) 
           

         

        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

         

       
       

     

    For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:

     

     ``x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"``  

     
     

     

    .. note::

       

      You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.

       

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    In addition to ``s3:CreateBucket`` , the following permissions are required when your CreateBucket includes specific headers:

     

     
    * **ACLs** - If your ``CreateBucket`` request specifies ACL permissions and the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you specify access permissions explicitly through any other ACL, both ``s3:CreateBucket`` and ``s3:PutBucketAcl`` permissions are needed. If the ACL the ``CreateBucket`` request is private or doesn't specify any ACLs, only ``s3:CreateBucket`` permission is needed.  
     
    * **Object Lock** - If ``ObjectLockEnabledForBucket`` is set to true in your ``CreateBucket`` request, ``s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration`` and ``s3:PutBucketVersioning`` permissions are required. 
     
    * **S3 Object Ownership** - If your CreateBucket request includes the the ``x-amz-object-ownership`` header, ``s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls`` permission is required. 
     

     

    The following operations are related to ``CreateBucket`` :

     

     
    * `PutObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html>`__   
     
    * `DeleteBucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucket.html>`__

  .. py:method:: delete_objects(**kwargs)

    

    This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

     

    The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

     

    The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body.

     

    When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete>`__.

     

    Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.

            - **Message** *(string) --* 

              The error message contains a generic description of the error condition in English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs display the message directly to the end user if they encounter an error condition they don't know how or don't care to handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error handling and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error message.

  .. py:method:: get_available_subresources()

        
    Returns a list of all the available sub-resources for this
    Resource.
    
    :returns: A list containing the name of each sub-resource for this
        resource
    :rtype: list of str


  .. py:method:: load(*args, **kwargs)

        
    Calls s3.Client.list_buckets() to update the attributes of the Bucket
    resource.


  .. py:method:: put_object(**kwargs)

    

    Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.

     

    Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.

     

    Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead.

     

    To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the ``Content-MD5`` header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * To successfully complete the ``PutObject`` request, you must have the ``s3:PutObject`` in your IAM permissions. 
       
      * To successfully change the objects acl of your ``PutObject`` request, you must have the ``s3:PutObjectAcl`` in your IAM permissions. 
       
      * The ``Content-MD5`` header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see `Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .  
       

       

     

     **Server-side Encryption**  

     

    You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see `Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__.

     

    If you request server-side encryption using Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Bucket Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers**  

     

    You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ and `Managing ACLs Using the REST API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html>`__. 

     

    If the bucket that you're uploading objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the ``bucket-owner-full-control`` canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return a ``400`` error with the error code ``AccessControlListNotSupported`` .

     

    For more information, see `Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.

       

     

     **Storage Class Options**  

     

    By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.

     

    For more information about versioning, see `Adding Objects to Versioning Enabled Buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html>`__. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see `GetBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html>`__.

    :type RetentionExpirationDate: datetime
    :param RetentionExpirationDate: Date on which it will be legal to delete or modify the object. You can only specify this or the Retention-Period header. If both are specified a 400 error will be returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used.

    
    :type RetentionLegalHoldId: string
    :param RetentionLegalHoldId: A single legal hold to apply to the object. A legal hold is a character long string of max length 64. The object cannot be overwritten or deleted until all legal holds associated with the object are removed.

    
    :type RetentionPeriod: integer
    :param RetentionPeriod: Retention period to store on the object in seconds. If this field and Retention-Expiration-Date are specified a 400 error is returned.

    :type StorageClass: string
    :param StorageClass: 

      By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

      

    
    :type WebsiteRedirectLocation: string
    :param WebsiteRedirectLocation: 

      If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For information about object metadata, see `Object Key and Metadata <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html>`__.

       

      In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:

       

       ``x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html``  

       

      In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to another website:

       

       ``x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/``  

       

      For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see `Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html>`__ and `How to Configure Website Page Redirects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html>`__.

      Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).

      

    
    :type SSECustomerKey: string
    :param SSECustomerKey: 

      Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`` header.

      

    
    :type SSECustomerKeyMD5: string
    :param SSECustomerKeyMD5: 

      Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

      :param Delimiter: 

        Character you use to group keys.

         

        All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if specified, and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are grouped under a single result element, ``CommonPrefixes`` . If you don't specify the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at the beginning of the key. The keys that are grouped under ``CommonPrefixes`` result element are not returned elsewhere in the response.

        

      
      :type EncodingType: string
      :param EncodingType: 

        Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and specifies the encoding method to use. An object key may contain any Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

        

      
      :type KeyMarker: string
      :param KeyMarker: 

        Together with upload-id-marker, this parameter specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin.

         

        If ``upload-id-marker`` is not specified, only the keys lexicographically greater than the specified ``key-marker`` will be included in the list.

         

        If ``upload-id-marker`` is specified, any multipart uploads for a key equal to the ``key-marker`` might also be included, provided those multipart uploads have upload IDs lexicographically greater than the specified ``upload-id-marker`` .

        

      
      :type MaxUploads: integer
      :param MaxUploads: 

        Sets the maximum number of multipart uploads, from 1 to 1,000, to return in the response body. 1,000 is the maximum number of uploads that can be returned in a response.

        

      
      :type MirrorDestination: string
      :param MirrorDestination: Mirror source for object reads.

      
      :type Prefix: string
      :param Prefix: 

        Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different grouping of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)

        

      
      :type UploadIdMarker: string
      :param UploadIdMarker: 

        Together with key-marker, specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin. If key-marker is not specified, the upload-id-marker parameter is ignored. Otherwise, any multipart uploads for a key equal to the key-marker might be included in the list only if they have an upload ID lexicographically greater than the specified ``upload-id-marker`` .

    .. py:method:: delete(**kwargs)

      

      This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

       

      The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

       

      The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body.

       

      When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete>`__.

       

      Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.

                The error message contains a generic description of the error condition in English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs display the message directly to the end user if they encounter an error condition they don't know how or don't care to handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error handling and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error message.

            ExpectedBucketOwner='string'
        )
      :type Delimiter: string
      :param Delimiter: 

        A delimiter is a character that you specify to group keys. All keys that contain the same string between the ``prefix`` and the first occurrence of the delimiter are grouped under a single result element in CommonPrefixes. These groups are counted as one result against the max-keys limitation. These keys are not returned elsewhere in the response.

        

      
      :type EncodingType: string
      :param EncodingType: 

        Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and specifies the encoding method to use. An object key may contain any Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.

        

      
      :type KeyMarker: string
      :param KeyMarker: 

        Specifies the key to start with when listing objects in a bucket.

        

      
      :type MaxKeys: integer
      :param MaxKeys: 

        Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more. If additional keys satisfy the search criteria, but were not returned because max-keys was exceeded, the response contains <isTruncated>true</isTruncated>. To return the additional keys, see key-marker and version-id-marker.

        

      
      :type Prefix: string
      :param Prefix: 

        Use this parameter to select only those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different groupings of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.) You can use prefix with delimiter to roll up numerous objects into a single result under CommonPrefixes.

    .. py:method:: delete(**kwargs)

      

      This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.

       

      The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

       

      The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body.

       

      When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see `MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete>`__.

       

      Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.

                The error message contains a generic description of the error condition in English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs display the message directly to the end user if they encounter an error condition they don't know how or don't care to handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error handling and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error message.

    **Request Syntax** 

    ::

      bucket_acl.load()
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: put(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL). For more information, see `Using ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have ``WRITE_ACP`` permission.

     

    You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:

     

     
    * Specify the ACL in the request body 
     
    * Specify permissions using request headers 
     

     

    .. note::

       

      You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.

       

     

    Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the ``AccessControlListNotSupported`` error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see `Controlling object ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

     

     **Access Permissions**  

     

    You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of ``x-amz-acl`` . If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the ``x-amz-acl`` header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: 

       
      * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account 
       
      * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group 
       
      * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account 

      .. note::

         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

           
          * US East (N. Virginia) 
           
          * US West (N. California) 
           
          * US West (Oregon) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
           
          * Europe (Ireland) 
           
          * South America (São Paulo) 
           

         

        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

         

       
       

     

    For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-write`` header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.

     

     ``x-amz-grant-write: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery", id="111122223333", id="555566667777"``  

     
     

     

    You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.

     

     **Grantee Values**  

     

    You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:

     

     
    * By the person's ID:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>``   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request 
     
    * By URI:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>``   
     
    * By Email address:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>``   The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.  

    .. note::

       Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

         
        * US East (N. Virginia) 
         
        * US West (N. California) 
         
        * US West (Oregon) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

    ::

      bucket_cors.load()
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: put(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the ``cors`` configuration for your bucket. If the configuration exists, Amazon S3 replaces it.

     

    To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the ``s3:PutBucketCORS`` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.

     

    You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is ``http://www.example.com`` to access your Amazon S3 bucket at ``my.example.bucket.com`` by using the browser's ``XMLHttpRequest`` capability.

     

    To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the ``cors`` subresource to the bucket. The ``cors`` subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size. 

     

    When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the ``cors`` configuration on the bucket and uses the first ``CORSRule`` rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:

     

     
    * The request's ``Origin`` header must match ``AllowedOrigin`` elements. 
     
    * The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the ``Access-Control-Request-Method`` header in case of a pre-flight ``OPTIONS`` request must be one of the ``AllowedMethod`` elements.  
     
    * Every header specified in the ``Access-Control-Request-Headers`` request header of a pre-flight request must match an ``AllowedHeader`` element.

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: delete(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified bucket. Amazon S3 removes all the lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle subresource associated with the bucket. Your objects never expire, and Amazon S3 no longer automatically deletes any objects on the basis of rules contained in the deleted lifecycle configuration.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and the bucket owner can grant this permission to others.

     

    There is usually some time lag before lifecycle configuration deletion is fully propagated to all the Amazon S3 systems.

     

    For more information about the object expiration, see `Elements to Describe Lifecycle Actions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#intro-lifecycle-rules-actions>`__.

  .. py:method:: get_available_subresources()

    Resource.
    
    :returns: A list containing the name of each sub-resource for this
        resource
    :rtype: list of str


  .. py:method:: load()

    Calls :py:meth:`S3.Client.get_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` to update the attributes of the BucketLifecycleConfiguration resource. Note that the load and reload methods are the same method and can be used interchangeably.

    See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/s3-2006-03-01/None>`_    


    **Request Syntax** 

    ::

      bucket_lifecycle_configuration.load()
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: put(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an existing lifecycle configuration. Keep in mind that this will overwrite an existing lifecycle configuration, so if you want to retain any configuration details, they must be included in the new lifecycle configuration. For information about lifecycle configuration, see `Managing your storage lifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

      Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API. The previous version of the API supported filtering based only on an object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compatibility. For the related API description, see `PutBucketLifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html>`__.

       

     

     **Rules**  

     

    You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The lifecycle configuration is specified as XML consisting of one or more rules. Each rule consists of the following:

     

     
    * Filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies. The filter can be based on a key name prefix, object tags, or a combination of both. 
     
    * Status whether the rule is in effect. 
     
    * One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you want Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter. If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object (one current version and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined actions that you can specify for current and noncurrent object versions. 
     

     

    For more information, see `Object Lifecycle Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ and `Lifecycle Configuration Elements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html>`__.

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration). Only the resource owner (that is, the Amazon Web Services account that created it) can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, a user must get the ``s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`` permission.

     

    You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also supersedes any other permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:

     

     
    * ``s3:DeleteObject``   
     
    * ``s3:DeleteObjectVersion``   
     
    * ``s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration``   
     

     

    For more information about permissions, see `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

  For more information about identifiers refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: bucket_name

    *(string)* The BucketTagging's bucket_name identifier. This **must** be set.
  .. rst-class:: admonition-title
  
  Attributes
  
  Attributes provide access to the properties of a resource. Attributes are lazy-loaded the first time one is accessed via the :py:meth:`load` method.
  For more information about attributes refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: tag_set

    

    - *(list) --* 

      Contains the tag set.

      
      

      - *(dict) --*

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: delete(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the tags from the bucket.

     

    To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:PutBucketTagging`` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant this permission to others. 

     

    The following operations are related to ``DeleteBucketTagging`` :

  .. py:method:: put(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the tags for a bucket.

     

    Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see `Cost Allocation and Tagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html>`__ and `Using Cost Allocation in Amazon S3 Bucket Tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CostAllocTagging.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

      When this operation sets the tags for a bucket, it will overwrite any current tags the bucket already has. You cannot use this operation to add tags to an existing list of tags.

       

     

    To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:PutBucketTagging`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

  .. py:method:: enable(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the versioning state of an existing bucket.

     

    You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:

     

     **Enabled** —Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

     

     **Suspended** —Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

     

    If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no versioning state; a `GetBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html>`__ request does not return a versioning state value.

     

    In order to enable MFA Delete, you must be the bucket owner. If you are the bucket owner and want to enable MFA Delete in the bucket versioning configuration, you must include the ``x-amz-mfa request`` header and the ``Status`` and the ``MfaDelete`` request elements in a request to set the versioning state of the bucket.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.)

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: delete(**kwargs)

    

    This action removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a ``200 OK`` response upon successfully deleting a website configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a ``200 OK`` response if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a ``404`` response if the bucket specified in the request does not exist.

     

    This DELETE action requires the ``S3:DeleteBucketWebsite`` permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the ``S3:DeleteBucketWebsite`` permission. 

     

    For more information about hosting websites, see `Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html>`__. 

     

    The following operations are related to ``DeleteBucketWebsite`` :

     

     
    * `GetBucketWebsite <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketWebsite.html>`__   
     
    * `PutBucketWebsite <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketWebsite.html>`__

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = bucket_website.delete(
          ExpectedBucketOwner='string'
      )
    :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
    :param ExpectedBucketOwner: Ignored by COS if present.

    
    
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: get_available_subresources()

        
    Returns a list of all the available sub-resources for this
    Resource.
    
    :returns: A list containing the name of each sub-resource for this
        resource
    :rtype: list of str


  .. py:method:: load()

    Calls :py:meth:`S3.Client.get_bucket_website` to update the attributes of the BucketWebsite resource. Note that the load and reload methods are the same method and can be used interchangeably.

    See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/s3-2006-03-01/None>`_    


    **Request Syntax** 

    ::

      bucket_website.load()
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: put(**kwargs)

    

    Sets the configuration of the website that is specified in the ``website`` subresource. To configure a bucket as a website, you can add this subresource on the bucket with website configuration information such as the file name of the index document and any redirect rules. For more information, see `Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html>`__.

     

    This PUT action requires the ``S3:PutBucketWebsite`` permission. By default, only the bucket owner can configure the website attached to a bucket; however, bucket owners can allow other users to set the website configuration by writing a bucket policy that grants them the ``S3:PutBucketWebsite`` permission.

     

    To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint, you add a website configuration with the following elements. Because all requests are sent to another website, you don't need to provide index document name for the bucket.

     

     
    * ``WebsiteConfiguration``   
     
    * ``RedirectAllRequestsTo``   
     
    * ``HostName``   
     
    * ``Protocol``   
     

     

    If you want granular control over redirects, you can use the following elements to add routing rules that describe conditions for redirecting requests and information about the redirect destination. In this case, the website configuration must provide an index document for the bucket, because some requests might not be redirected. 

     

     
    * ``WebsiteConfiguration``   
     
    * ``IndexDocument``   
     
    * ``Suffix``   
     
    * ``ErrorDocument``   
     
    * ``Key``   
     
    * ``RoutingRules``   
     
    * ``RoutingRule``   
     
    * ``Condition``   
     
    * ``HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals``   
     
    * ``KeyPrefixEquals``   
     
    * ``Redirect``   
     
    * ``Protocol``   
     
    * ``HostName``   
     
    * ``ReplaceKeyPrefixWith``   
     
    * ``ReplaceKeyWith``   
     
    * ``HttpRedirectCode``   
     

     

    Amazon S3 has a limitation of 50 routing rules per website configuration. If you require more than 50 routing rules, you can use object redirect. For more information, see `Configuring an Object Redirect <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

  Attributes
  
  Attributes provide access to the properties of a resource. Attributes are lazy-loaded the first time one is accessed via the :py:meth:`load` method.
  For more information about attributes refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: initiated

    

    - *(datetime) --* 

      Date and time at which the multipart upload was initiated.

      

  .. py:attribute:: initiator

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Identifies who initiated the multipart upload.

      
      

      - **ID** *(string) --* 

        If the principal is an Amazon Web Services account, it provides the Canonical User ID. If the principal is an IAM User, it provides a user ARN value.

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: abort(**kwargs)

    

    This action aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts. 

     

    To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the part storage, you should call the `ListParts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html>`__ action and ensure that the parts list is empty.

     

    For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload, see `Multipart Upload and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__.

     

    The following operations are related to ``AbortMultipartUpload`` :

  .. py:method:: complete(**kwargs)

    

    Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.

     

    You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__ operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this action to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This action concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the ``ETag`` value, returned after that part was uploaded.

     

    Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response body to determine whether the request succeeded.

     

    Note that if ``CompleteMultipartUpload`` fails, applications should be prepared to retry the failed requests. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Error Best Practices <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ErrorBestPractices.html>`__.

     

    .. warning::

       

      You cannot use ``Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` with Complete Multipart Upload requests. Also, if you do not provide a ``Content-Type`` header, ``CompleteMultipartUpload`` returns a 200 OK response.

     ``CompleteMultipartUpload`` has the following special errors:

     

     
    * Error code: ``EntityTooSmall``   

       
      * Description: Your proposed upload is smaller than the minimum allowed object size. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. 
       
      * 400 Bad Request 
       

     
     
    * Error code: ``InvalidPart``   

       
      * Description: One or more of the specified parts could not be found. The part might not have been uploaded, or the specified entity tag might not have matched the part's entity tag. 
       
      * 400 Bad Request 
       

     
     
    * Error code: ``InvalidPartOrder``   

       
      * Description: The list of parts was not in ascending order. The parts list must be specified in order by part number. 
       
      * 400 Bad Request 
       

     
     
    * Error code: ``NoSuchUpload``   

       
      * Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: copy_from(**kwargs)

    

    Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. You specify the data source by adding the request header ``x-amz-copy-source`` in your request and a byte range by adding the request header ``x-amz-copy-source-range`` in your request. 

     

    The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more information about multipart upload limits, go to `Quick Facts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/qfacts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    .. note::

       

      Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__ action and provide data in your request.

       

     

    You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part request.

     

    For more information about using the ``UploadPartCopy`` operation, see the following:

     

     
    * For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see `Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 
     
    * For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see `Multipart Upload and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 
     
    * For information about copying objects using a single atomic action vs. a multipart upload, see `Operations on Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectOperations.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 
     
    * For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys with the ``UploadPartCopy`` operation, see `CopyObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html>`__ and `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__. 
     

     

    Note the following additional considerations about the request headers ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` , ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` , ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` , and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` :

     

     

     

     
    * **Consideration 1** - If both of the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` headers are present in the request as follows:  ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and;  ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ; Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` and copies the data.  
     
    * **Consideration 2** - If both of the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` headers are present in the request as follows:  ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and;  ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; Amazon S3 returns ``412 Precondition Failed`` response code.  
     

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the ``x-amz-copy-source`` , Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the ``x-amz-copy-source`` and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the ``x-amz-copy-source`` . 

     

    You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the ``versionId`` subresource as shown in the following example:

     

     ``x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id``

      )
    :type CopySource: str or dict
    :param CopySource: **[REQUIRED]** The name of the source bucket, key name of the source object, and optional version ID of the source object.  You can either provide this value as a string or a dictionary.  The string form is {bucket}/{key} or {bucket}/{key}?versionId={versionId} if you want to copy a specific version.  You can also provide this value as a dictionary.  The dictionary format is recommended over the string format because it is more explicit.  The dictionary format is: {'Bucket': 'bucket', 'Key': 'key', 'VersionId': 'id'}.  Note that the VersionId key is optional and may be omitted. To specify an S3 access point, provide the access point ARN for the ``Bucket`` key in the copy source dictionary. If you want to provide the copy source for an S3 access point as a string instead of a dictionary, the ARN provided must be the full S3 access point object ARN (i.e. {accesspoint_arn}/object/{key})

    
    :type CopySourceIfMatch: string
    :param CopySourceIfMatch: 

      Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.

      

    
    :type CopySourceIfModifiedSince: datetime
    :param CopySourceIfModifiedSince: 

      Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.

      

    
    :type CopySourceIfNoneMatch: string
    :param CopySourceIfNoneMatch: 

      Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the specified ETag.

      

    
    :type CopySourceIfUnmodifiedSince: datetime
    :param CopySourceIfUnmodifiedSince: 

      Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified time.

      

    
    :type CopySourceRange: string
    :param CopySourceRange: 

      The range of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value must use the form bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the zero-based byte offsets to copy. For example, bytes=0-9 indicates that you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy a range only if the source object is greater than 5 MB.

      

    
    :type SSECustomerAlgorithm: string
    :param SSECustomerAlgorithm: 

      Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).

      

    
    :type SSECustomerKey: string
    :param SSECustomerKey: 

      Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`` header. This must be the same encryption key specified in the initiate multipart upload request.

      

    
    :type SSECustomerKeyMD5: string
    :param SSECustomerKeyMD5: 

      Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

    Returns a list of all the available sub-resources for this
    Resource.
    
    :returns: A list containing the name of each sub-resource for this
        resource
    :rtype: list of str


  .. py:method:: upload(**kwargs)

    

    Uploads a part in a multipart upload.

     

    .. note::

       

      In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the `UploadPartCopy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html>`__ operation. 

       

     

    You must initiate a multipart upload (see `CreateMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html>`__ ) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.

     

    Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.

     

    To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the ``Content-MD5`` header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. 

     

    If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the ``x-amz-content-sha256`` header as a checksum instead of ``Content-MD5`` . For more information see `Authenticating Requests\: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html>`__. 

     

     **Note:** After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.

     

    For more information on multipart uploads, go to `Multipart Upload Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to `Multipart Upload and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using `CreateMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html>`__. For more information, go to `Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see `CreateMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html>`__.

     

    If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following headers.

     

     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

    * 

      
      * *Code: NoSuchUpload*   
       
      * *Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.*

      Specifies presentational information for the object.

      

  .. py:attribute:: content_encoding

    

    - *(string) --* 

      Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

      

  .. py:attribute:: content_language

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The language the content is in.

    - *(integer) --* 

      Size of the body in bytes.

      

  .. py:attribute:: content_type

    

    - *(string) --* 

      A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

      

  .. py:attribute:: delete_marker

    

    - *(boolean) --* 

      Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not appear in the response.

      

  .. py:attribute:: e_tag

    

    - *(string) --* 

      An entity tag (ETag) is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.

      

  .. py:attribute:: expiration

    

    - *(string) --* 

      If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response includes this header. It includes the ``expiry-date`` and ``rule-id`` key-value pairs providing object expiration information. The value of the ``rule-id`` is URL-encoded.

      

  .. py:attribute:: expires

    

    - *(datetime) --* 

      The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

      

  .. py:attribute:: ibm_restored_copy_storage_class

    

    - *(string) --* This header is only included if an object has transition metadata. This header will indicate the transition storage class and time of transition. If this header and the x-amz-restore header are both included, this header will indicate the time at which the object was originally archived.

  .. py:attribute:: ibm_transition

    

    - *(string) --* This header is only included if an object has transition metadata. This header will indicate the transition storage class and time of transition. If this header and the x-amz-restore header are both included, this header will indicate the time at which the object was originally archived.

  .. py:attribute:: last_modified

    

    - *(datetime) --* 

      Creation date of the object.

      

  .. py:attribute:: metadata

    

    - *(dict) --*

        - *(string) --* 
  


  .. py:attribute:: missing_meta

    

    - *(integer) --* 

      This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in ``x-amz-meta`` headers. This can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more flexible metadata than the REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose values are not legal HTTP headers.

      

  .. py:attribute:: object_lock_legal_hold_status

    

    - *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether a legal hold is in effect for this object. This header is only returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectLegalHold`` permission. This header is not returned if the specified version of this object has never had a legal hold applied. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see `Object Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html>`__.

      

  .. py:attribute:: object_lock_mode

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The Object Lock mode, if any, that's in effect for this object. This header is only returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectRetention`` permission. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see `Object Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html>`__. 

      

  .. py:attribute:: object_lock_retain_until_date

    

    - *(datetime) --* 

      The date and time when the Object Lock retention period expires. This header is only returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectRetention`` permission.

      

  .. py:attribute:: parts_count

    

    - *(integer) --* 

      The count of parts this object has. This value is only returned if you specify ``partNumber`` in your request and the object was uploaded as a multipart upload.

      

  .. py:attribute:: replication_status

    

    - *(string) --* 

      Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or a destination in a replication rule.

       

      In replication, you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and destination bucket or buckets where Amazon S3 stores object replicas. When you request an object ( ``GetObject`` ) or object metadata ( ``HeadObject`` ) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header in the response as follows:

       

       
      * **If requesting an object from the source bucket** , Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header if the object in your request is eligible for replication. For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify object prefix ``TaxDocs`` requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix ``TaxDocs`` . Any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example ``TaxDocs/document1.pdf`` , are eligible for replication. For any object request with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating object replication status. 
       
      * **If requesting an object from a destination bucket** , Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header with value REPLICA if the object in your request is a replica that Amazon S3 created and there is no replica modification replication in progress. 
       
      * **When replicating objects to multiple destination buckets** , the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header acts differently. The header of the source object will only return a value of COMPLETED when replication is successful to all destinations. The header will remain at value PENDING until replication has completed for all destinations. If one or more destinations fails replication the header will return FAILED.  
       

       

      For more information, see `Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__.

      

  .. py:attribute:: request_charged

    

    - *(string) --* 

      If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

      

  .. py:attribute:: restore

    

    - *(string) --* 

      If the object is an archived object (an object whose storage class is GLACIER), the response includes this header if either the archive restoration is in progress (see `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__ or an archive copy is already restored.

       

      If an archive copy is already restored, the header value indicates when Amazon S3 is scheduled to delete the object copy. For example:

       

       ``x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Fri, 21 Dec 2012 00:00:00 GMT"``  

       

      If the object restoration is in progress, the header returns the value ``ongoing-request="true"`` .

       

      For more information about archiving objects, see `Transitioning Objects\: General Considerations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-transition-general-considerations>`__.

      

  .. py:attribute:: retention_expiration_date

    

    - *(datetime) --* Date on which it will be legal to delete or modify the object. You can only specify this or the Retention-Period header. If both are specified a 400 error will be returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 

  .. py:attribute:: retention_legal_hold_count

    

    - *(integer) --* Returns the count of legal holds on the object. If there are no legal holds, the header is not returned

  .. py:attribute:: retention_period

    

    - *(integer) --* Retention period to store on the object in seconds. If this field and Retention-Expiration-Date are specified a 400 error is returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 0 is a legal value assuming the bucket's minimum retention period is also 0.

  .. py:attribute:: server_side_encryption

    

    - *(string) --* 

      If the object is stored using server-side encryption either with an Amazon Web Services KMS key or an Amazon S3-managed encryption key, the response includes this header with the value of the server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

      

  .. py:attribute:: sse_customer_algorithm

    

    - *(string) --* 

      If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

      

  .. py:attribute:: sse_customer_key_md5

    

    - *(string) --* 

      If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will include this header to provide round-trip message integrity verification of the customer-provided encryption key.

      

  .. py:attribute:: ssekms_key_id

    

    - *(string) --* 

      If present, specifies the ID of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) symmetric customer managed key that was used for the object.

      

  .. py:attribute:: storage_class

    

    - *(string) --* 

      Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for all objects except for S3 Standard storage class objects.

       

      For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__.

      

  .. py:attribute:: version_id

    

    - *(string) --* 

      Version of the object.

      

  .. py:attribute:: website_redirect_location

    

    - *(string) --* 

      If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata.

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: copy(CopySource, ExtraArgs=None, Callback=None, SourceClient=None, Config=None)

        
    Copy an object from one S3 location to this object.
    
    This is a managed transfer which will perform a multipart copy in
    multiple threads if necessary.
    
    Usage::
    
        import ibm_boto3
        s3 = ibm_boto3.resource('s3')
        copy_source = {
            'Bucket': 'mybucket',
            'Key': 'mykey'
        }
        bucket = s3.Bucket('otherbucket')
        obj = bucket.Object('otherkey')
        obj.copy(copy_source)
    
    :type CopySource: dict
    :param CopySource: The name of the source bucket, key name of the
        source object, and optional version ID of the source object. The
        dictionary format is:
        ``{'Bucket': 'bucket', 'Key': 'key', 'VersionId': 'id'}``. Note
        that the ``VersionId`` key is optional and may be omitted.
    
    :type ExtraArgs: dict
    :param ExtraArgs: Extra arguments that may be passed to the
        client operation. For allowed download arguments see
        ibm_boto3.s3.transfer.S3Transfer.ALLOWED_DOWNLOAD_ARGS.
    
    :type Callback: function
    :param Callback: A method which takes a number of bytes transferred to
        be periodically called during the copy.
    
    :type SourceClient: ibm_botocore or ibm_boto3 Client
    :param SourceClient: The client to be used for operation that
        may happen at the source object. For example, this client is
        used for the head_object that determines the size of the copy.
        If no client is provided, the current client is used as the client
        for the source object.
    
    :type Config: ibm_boto3.s3.transfer.TransferConfig
    :param Config: The transfer configuration to be used when performing the
        copy.


  .. py:method:: copy_from(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

     

    .. note::

       

      You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy) API. For more information, see `Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html>`__.

       

     

    All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have *read* access to the source object and *write* access to the destination bucket. For more information, see `REST Authentication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html>`__. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.

     

    A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the ``200 OK`` response. This means that a ``200 OK`` response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.

     

    If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.

     

    .. note::

       

      If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.

       

     

    The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see `Amazon S3 pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/>`__.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 ``Bad Request`` error. For more information, see `Transfer Acceleration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html>`__.

       

     

     **Metadata**  

     

    When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see `Using ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__. 

     

    To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the ``x-amz-metadata-directive`` header. When you grant permissions, you can use the ``s3:x-amz-metadata-directive`` condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see `Specifying Conditions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys, see `Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html>`__.

     

     **x-amz-copy-source-if Headers**  

     

    To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the ``Etag`` matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the following request parameters:

     

     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match``   
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match``   
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since``   
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since``   
     

     

    If both the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` and copies the data:

     

     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` condition evaluates to true 
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` condition evaluates to false 
     

     

    If both the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the ``412 Precondition Failed`` response code:

     

     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` condition evaluates to false 
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` condition evaluates to true 
     

     

    .. note::

       

      All headers with the ``x-amz-`` prefix, including ``x-amz-copy-source`` , must be signed.

       

     

     **Server-side encryption**  

     

    When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the object using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see `Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__.

     

    If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Bucket Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers**  

     

    When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ and `Managing ACLs Using the REST API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html>`__. 

     

    If the bucket that you're copying objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the ``bucket-owner-full-control`` canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format.

     

    For more information, see `Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.

       

     

     **Checksums**  

     

    When copying an object, if it has a checksum, that checksum will be copied to the new object by default. When you copy the object over, you may optionally specify a different checksum algorithm to use with the ``x-amz-checksum-algorithm`` header.

     

     **Storage Class Options**  

     

    You can use the ``CopyObject`` action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the ``StorageClass`` parameter. For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

     

    If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the ``x-amz-version-id`` response header in the response.

     

    If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.

     

    If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__.

     

    The following operations are related to ``CopyObject`` :

     

     
    * `PutObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html>`__   
     
    * `GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html>`__   
     

     

    For more information, see `Copying Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjectsExamples.html>`__.

You can also provide this value as a dictionary.  The dictionary format is recommended over the string format because it is more explicit.  The dictionary format is: {'Bucket': 'bucket', 'Key': 'key', 'VersionId': 'id'}.  Note that the VersionId key is optional and may be omitted. To specify an S3 access point, provide the access point ARN for the ``Bucket`` key in the copy source dictionary. If you want to provide the copy source for an S3 access point as a string instead of a dictionary, the ARN provided must be the full S3 access point object ARN (i.e. {accesspoint_arn}/object/{key})

  .. py:method:: delete(**kwargs)

    

    Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but will still respond that the command was successful.

     

    To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the version Id subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header, ``x-amz-delete-marker`` , to true. 

     

    If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the ``x-amz-mfa`` request header in the DELETE ``versionId`` request. Requests that include ``x-amz-mfa`` must use HTTPS. 

     

    For more information about MFA Delete, see `Using MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMFADelete.html>`__. To see sample requests that use versioning, see `Sample Request <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html#ExampleVersionObjectDelete>`__. 

     

    You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or configure its lifecycle ( `PutBucketLifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html>`__ ) to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them the ``s3:DeleteObject`` , ``s3:DeleteObjectVersion`` , and ``s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration`` actions. 

     

    The following action is related to ``DeleteObject`` :

  .. py:method:: get(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use ``GET`` , you must have ``READ`` access to the object. If you grant ``READ`` access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header.

     

    An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object ``sample.jpg`` , you can name it ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` .

     

    To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the ``GET`` operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` , specify the resource as ``/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For a path-style request example, if you have the object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` in the bucket named ``examplebucket`` , specify the resource as ``/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For more information about request types, see `HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket>`__.

     

    For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see `GetObjectAcl <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html>`__.

     

    If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__. Otherwise, this action returns an ``InvalidObjectStateError`` error. For information about restoring archived objects, see `Restoring Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__.

     

    Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

     

    If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:

     

     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 
     

     

    For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__.

     

    Assuming you have the relevant permission to read object tags, the response also returns the ``x-amz-tagging-count`` header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use `GetObjectTagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTagging.html>`__ to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission.

     

     
    * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error. 
     
    * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error. 
     

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * If you supply a ``versionId`` , you need the ``s3:GetObjectVersion`` permission to access a specific version of an object. If you request a specific version, you do not need to have the ``s3:GetObject`` permission.  
       
      * If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes ``x-amz-delete-marker: true`` in the response. 
       

       

     

    For more information about versioning, see `PutBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html>`__. 

     

     **Overriding Response Header Values**  

     

    There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might override the ``Content-Disposition`` response header value in your GET request.

     

    You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are ``Content-Type`` , ``Content-Language`` , ``Expires`` , ``Cache-Control`` , ``Content-Disposition`` , and ``Content-Encoding`` . To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.

     

    .. note::

       

      You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.

       

     

     
    * ``response-content-type``   
     
    * ``response-content-language``   
     
    * ``response-expires``   
     
    * ``response-cache-control``   
     
    * ``response-content-disposition``   
     
    * ``response-content-encoding``   
     

     

     **Additional Considerations about Request Headers**  

     

    If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and; ``If-Unmodified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested. 

     

    If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: ``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and; ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.

     

    For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__.

        - **RetentionExpirationDate** *(datetime) --* Date on which it will be legal to delete or modify the object. You can only specify this or the Retention-Period header. If both are specified a 400 error will be returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 
        

        - **RetentionLegalHoldCount** *(integer) --* Returns the count of legal holds on the object. If there are no legal holds, the header is not returned
        

        - **RetentionPeriod** *(integer) --* Retention period to store on the object in seconds. If this field and Retention-Expiration-Date are specified a 400 error is returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 0 is a legal value assuming the bucket's minimum retention period is also 0.
        

        - **SSECustomerAlgorithm** *(string) --* 

          If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

          
        

        - **SSECustomerKeyMD5** *(string) --*

          Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for all objects except for S3 Standard storage class objects.

          
        

        - **RequestCharged** *(string) --* 

          If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

          
        

        - **ReplicationStatus** *(string) --* 

          Amazon S3 can return this if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or destination in a replication rule.

          
        

        - **PartsCount** *(integer) --* 

          The count of parts this object has. This value is only returned if you specify ``partNumber`` in your request and the object was uploaded as a multipart upload.

          
        

        - **TagCount** *(integer) --* 

          The number of tags, if any, on the object.

        - **IbmRestoredCopyStorageClass** *(string) --* This header is only included if an object has transition metadata. This header will indicate the transition storage class and time of transition. If this header and the x-amz-restore header are both included, this header will indicate the time at which the object was originally archived.
        

        - **IbmTransition** *(string) --* This header is only included if an object has transition metadata. This header will indicate the transition storage class and time of transition. If this header and the x-amz-restore header are both included, this header will indicate the time at which the object was originally archived.
    

  .. py:method:: get_available_subresources()

        
    Returns a list of all the available sub-resources for this
    Resource.
    
    :returns: A list containing the name of each sub-resource for this
        resource
    :rtype: list of str


  .. py:method:: initiate_multipart_upload(**kwargs)

    

    This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__ ). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.

     

    For more information about multipart uploads, see `Multipart Upload Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html>`__.

     

    If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see `Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config>`__.

     

    For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see `Multipart Upload and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__.

     

    For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see `Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

      After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. 

       

     

    You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use Amazon Web Services KMS keys or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__ and `UploadPartCopy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html>`__ requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using ``CreateMultipartUpload`` . 

     

    To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the ``kms:Decrypt`` and ``kms:GenerateDataKey*`` actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see `Multipart upload API and permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.

     

    For more information, see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__.

      Access Permissions  

    When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__. 
     

     

    You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.

      Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers  

    You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. 

     

     
    * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer managed key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request. 

       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-context``   
       

     

    .. note::

       

      If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but don't provide ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key in Amazon Web Services KMS to protect the data.

       

     

    .. warning::

       

      All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by Amazon Web Services KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.

       

     

    For more information about server-side encryption with KMS key (SSE-KMS), see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__.

     
     
    * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request. 

       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5``   
       

     

    For more information about server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS), see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__.

     
     

      Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers  

    You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see `Using ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL ( ``x-amz-acl`` ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use: 

       
      * ``x-amz-grant-read``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-write``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-read-acp``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-write-acp``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-full-control``   
       

     

    You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

     

       
      * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account 
       
      * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group 
       
      * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account 

      .. note::

         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

           
          * US East (N. Virginia) 
           
          * US West (N. California) 
           
          * US West (Oregon) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
           
          * Europe (Ireland) 
           
          * South America (São Paulo) 
           

         

        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

         

       
       

     

    For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:

     

     ``x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"``

    **Request Syntax** 

    ::

      object.load()
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: put(**kwargs)

    

    Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.

     

    Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.

     

    Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead.

     

    To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the ``Content-MD5`` header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * To successfully complete the ``PutObject`` request, you must have the ``s3:PutObject`` in your IAM permissions. 
       
      * To successfully change the objects acl of your ``PutObject`` request, you must have the ``s3:PutObjectAcl`` in your IAM permissions. 
       
      * The ``Content-MD5`` header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see `Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .  
       

       

     

     **Server-side Encryption**  

     

    You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see `Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__.

     

    If you request server-side encryption using Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Bucket Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers**  

     

    You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ and `Managing ACLs Using the REST API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html>`__. 

     

    If the bucket that you're uploading objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the ``bucket-owner-full-control`` canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return a ``400`` error with the error code ``AccessControlListNotSupported`` .

     

    For more information, see `Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.

       

     

     **Storage Class Options**  

     

    By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.

     

    For more information about versioning, see `Adding Objects to Versioning Enabled Buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html>`__. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see `GetBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html>`__.

    :type RetentionExpirationDate: datetime
    :param RetentionExpirationDate: Date on which it will be legal to delete or modify the object. You can only specify this or the Retention-Period header. If both are specified a 400 error will be returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used.

    
    :type RetentionLegalHoldId: string
    :param RetentionLegalHoldId: A single legal hold to apply to the object. A legal hold is a character long string of max length 64. The object cannot be overwritten or deleted until all legal holds associated with the object are removed.

    
    :type RetentionPeriod: integer
    :param RetentionPeriod: Retention period to store on the object in seconds. If this field and Retention-Expiration-Date are specified a 400 error is returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 0 is a legal value assuming the bucket's minimum retention period is also 0.

    
    :type ServerSideEncryption: string
    :param ServerSideEncryption: 

      The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

      

    
    :type StorageClass: string
    :param StorageClass: 

      By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

      

    
    :type WebsiteRedirectLocation: string
    :param WebsiteRedirectLocation: 

      If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For information about object metadata, see `Object Key and Metadata <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html>`__.

       

      In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:

       

       ``x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html``  

       

      In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to another website:

       

       ``x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/``  

       

      For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see `Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html>`__ and `How to Configure Website Page Redirects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html>`__. 

      

    
    :type SSECustomerAlgorithm: string
    :param SSECustomerAlgorithm: 

      Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).

      

    
    :type SSECustomerKey: string
    :param SSECustomerKey: 

      Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`` header.

      

    
    :type SSECustomerKeyMD5: string
    :param SSECustomerKeyMD5: 

      Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

            Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided. Including this parameter is not required



    
    :type SSEKMSKeyId: string
    :param SSEKMSKeyId: Ignored by COS if present.

    :type ObjectLockMode: string
    :param ObjectLockMode: 

      The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to this object.

      

    
    :type ObjectLockRetainUntilDate: datetime
    :param ObjectLockRetainUntilDate: 

      The date and time when you want this object's Object Lock to expire. Must be formatted as a timestamp parameter.

      

    
    :type ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus: string
    :param ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus: 

      Specifies whether a legal hold will be applied to this object. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see `Object Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html>`__.

  .. py:method:: restore_object(**kwargs)

    

    Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3

     

    This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

     

    This action performs the following types of requests: 

     

     
    * ``select`` - Perform a select query on an archived object 
     
    * ``restore an archive`` - Restore an archived object 
     

     

    To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3:RestoreObject`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Querying Archives with Select Requests**  

     

    You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview about select requests, see `Querying Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    When making a select request, do the following:

     

     
    * Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The Amazon Web Services account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see `Querying Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . For more information about the ``S3`` structure in the request body, see the following: 

       
      * `PutObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html>`__   
       
      * `Managing Access with ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*   
       
      * `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*   
       

     
     
    * Define the SQL expression for the ``SELECT`` type of restoration for your query in the request body's ``SelectParameters`` structure. You can use expressions like the following examples. 

       
      * The following expression returns all records from the specified object.  ``SELECT * FROM Object``   
       
      * Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.  ``SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 > 100``   
       
      * If you have headers and you set the ``fileHeaderInfo`` in the ``CSV`` structure in the request body to ``USE`` , you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the ``fileHeaderInfo`` field to ``IGNORE`` , the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names.   ``SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s``   
       

     
     

     

    For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see `SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    When making a select request, you can also do the following:

     

     
    * To expedite your queries, specify the ``Expedited`` tier. For more information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic. 
     
    * Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results. 
     

     

    The following are additional important facts about the select feature:

     

     
    * The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy. 
     
    * You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests. 
     
    * Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response ``409`` . 
     

     

     **Restoring objects**  

     

    Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time. For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.

     

    To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

     

    When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the ``Tier`` element of the request body: 

     

     
    * ``Expedited`` - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. 
     
    * ``Standard`` - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. 
     
    * ``Bulk`` - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. 
     

     

    For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for ``Expedited`` data access, see `Restoring Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see `Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    To get the status of object restoration, you can send a ``HEAD`` request. Operations return the ``x-amz-restore`` header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see `Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.

     

    If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html>`__ and `Object Lifecycle Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ in *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Responses**  

     

    A successful action returns either the ``200 OK`` or ``202 Accepted`` status code. 

     

     
    * If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns ``202 Accepted`` in the response.  
     
    * If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` in the response.  
     

     

     **Special Errors**  

     

     
    * 

      
      * *Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress*   
       
      * *Cause: Object restore is already in progress. (This error does not apply to SELECT type requests.)*

    **Request Syntax** 

    ::

      object_acl.load()
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: put(**kwargs)

    

    Uses the ``acl`` subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for a new or existing object in an S3 bucket. You must have ``WRITE_ACP`` permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see `What permissions can I grant? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#permissions>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

     

    Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    .. warning::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the ``AccessControlListNotSupported`` error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see `Controlling object ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

       

     

     **Access Permissions**  

     

    You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of ``x-amz-ac`` l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use ``x-amz-acl`` header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: 

       
      * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account 
       
      * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group 
       
      * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account 

      .. note::

         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

           
          * US East (N. Virginia) 
           
          * US West (N. California) 
           
          * US West (Oregon) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
           
          * Europe (Ireland) 
           
          * South America (São Paulo) 
           

         

        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

         

       
       

     

    For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants list objects permission to the two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.

     

     ``x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"``  

     
     

     

    You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.

     

     **Grantee Values**  

     

    You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:

     

     
    * By the person's ID:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee>``   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request. 
     
    * By URI:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>``   
     
    * By Email address:  ``<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>``   The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser. 

    .. note::

       Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

         
        * US East (N. Virginia) 
         
        * US West (N. California) 
         
        * US West (Oregon) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
         
        * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
         
        * Europe (Ireland) 
         
        * South America (São Paulo) 
         

       

      For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

       

     
     

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets the ACL of the current version of an object. To set the ACL of a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

  Identifiers
  
  Identifiers are properties of a resource that are set upon instantiation of the resource.
  For more information about identifiers refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: bucket_name

    *(string)* The ObjectSummary's bucket_name identifier. This **must** be set.

  .. py:attribute:: key

    *(string)* The ObjectSummary's key identifier. This **must** be set.

  Attributes
  
  Attributes provide access to the properties of a resource. Attributes are lazy-loaded the first time one is accessed via the :py:meth:`load` method.
  For more information about attributes refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<identifiers_attributes_intro>`.
  

  .. py:attribute:: e_tag

    

    - *(string) --* 

      The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects changes only to the contents of an object, not its metadata. The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object data. Whether or not it is depends on how the object was created and how it is encrypted as described below:

       

       
      * Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have ETags that are an MD5 digest of their object data. 
       
      * Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags that are not an MD5 digest of their object data. 
       
      * If an object is created by either the Multipart Upload or Part Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regardless of the method of encryption. 
       

      

  .. py:attribute:: last_modified

    

    - *(datetime) --* 

      Creation date of the object.

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: copy_from(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

     

    .. note::

       

      You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy) API. For more information, see `Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html>`__.

       

     

    All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have *read* access to the source object and *write* access to the destination bucket. For more information, see `REST Authentication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html>`__. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.

     

    A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the ``200 OK`` response. This means that a ``200 OK`` response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.

     

    If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.

     

    .. note::

       

      If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.

       

     

    The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see `Amazon S3 pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/>`__.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 ``Bad Request`` error. For more information, see `Transfer Acceleration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html>`__.

       

     

     **Metadata**  

     

    When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see `Using ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__. 

     

    To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the ``x-amz-metadata-directive`` header. When you grant permissions, you can use the ``s3:x-amz-metadata-directive`` condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see `Specifying Conditions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys, see `Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html>`__.

     

     **x-amz-copy-source-if Headers**  

     

    To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the ``Etag`` matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the following request parameters:

     

     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match``   
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match``   
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since``   
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since``   
     

     

    If both the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` and copies the data:

     

     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` condition evaluates to true 
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` condition evaluates to false 
     

     

    If both the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` and ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the ``412 Precondition Failed`` response code:

     

     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` condition evaluates to false 
     
    * ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` condition evaluates to true 
     

     

    .. note::

       

      All headers with the ``x-amz-`` prefix, including ``x-amz-copy-source`` , must be signed.

       

     

     **Server-side encryption**  

     

    When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the object using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see `Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__.

     

    If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Bucket Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers**  

     

    When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ and `Managing ACLs Using the REST API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html>`__. 

     

    If the bucket that you're copying objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the ``bucket-owner-full-control`` canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format.

     

    For more information, see `Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.

       

     

     **Checksums**  

     

    When copying an object, if it has a checksum, that checksum will be copied to the new object by default. When you copy the object over, you may optionally specify a different checksum algorithm to use with the ``x-amz-checksum-algorithm`` header.

     

     **Storage Class Options**  

     

    You can use the ``CopyObject`` action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the ``StorageClass`` parameter. For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

     

    If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the ``x-amz-version-id`` response header in the response.

     

    If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.

     

    If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__.

     

    The following operations are related to ``CopyObject`` :

     

     
    * `PutObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html>`__   
     
    * `GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html>`__   
     

     

    For more information, see `Copying Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjectsExamples.html>`__.

    :type ServerSideEncryption: string
    :param ServerSideEncryption: 

      The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

      

    
    :type StorageClass: string
    :param StorageClass: 

      By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

      

    
    :type WebsiteRedirectLocation: string

  .. py:method:: delete(**kwargs)

    

    Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but will still respond that the command was successful.

     

    To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the version Id subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header, ``x-amz-delete-marker`` , to true. 

     

    If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the ``x-amz-mfa`` request header in the DELETE ``versionId`` request. Requests that include ``x-amz-mfa`` must use HTTPS. 

     

    For more information about MFA Delete, see `Using MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMFADelete.html>`__. To see sample requests that use versioning, see `Sample Request <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html#ExampleVersionObjectDelete>`__. 

     

    You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or configure its lifecycle ( `PutBucketLifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html>`__ ) to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them the ``s3:DeleteObject`` , ``s3:DeleteObjectVersion`` , and ``s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration`` actions.

  .. py:method:: get(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use ``GET`` , you must have ``READ`` access to the object. If you grant ``READ`` access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header.

     

    An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object ``sample.jpg`` , you can name it ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` .

     

    To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the ``GET`` operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` , specify the resource as ``/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For a path-style request example, if you have the object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` in the bucket named ``examplebucket`` , specify the resource as ``/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For more information about request types, see `HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket>`__.

     

    For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see `GetObjectAcl <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html>`__.

     

    If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__. Otherwise, this action returns an ``InvalidObjectStateError`` error. For information about restoring archived objects, see `Restoring Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__.

     

    Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

     

    If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:

     

     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 
     

     

    For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__.

     

    Assuming you have the relevant permission to read object tags, the response also returns the ``x-amz-tagging-count`` header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use `GetObjectTagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTagging.html>`__ to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission.

     

     
    * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error. 
     
    * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error. 
     

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * If you supply a ``versionId`` , you need the ``s3:GetObjectVersion`` permission to access a specific version of an object. If you request a specific version, you do not need to have the ``s3:GetObject`` permission.  
       
      * If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes ``x-amz-delete-marker: true`` in the response. 
       

       

     

    For more information about versioning, see `PutBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html>`__. 

     

     **Overriding Response Header Values**  

     

    There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might override the ``Content-Disposition`` response header value in your GET request.

     

    You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are ``Content-Type`` , ``Content-Language`` , ``Expires`` , ``Cache-Control`` , ``Content-Disposition`` , and ``Content-Encoding`` . To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.

     

    .. note::

       

      You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.

       

     

     
    * ``response-content-type``   
     
    * ``response-content-language``   
     
    * ``response-expires``   
     
    * ``response-cache-control``   
     
    * ``response-content-disposition``   
     
    * ``response-content-encoding``   
     

     

     **Additional Considerations about Request Headers**  

     

    If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and; ``If-Unmodified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested. 

     

    If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: ``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and; ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.

     

    For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__.

     

    The following operations are related to ``GetObject`` :

     

     
    * `ListBuckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html>`__

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **Body** (:class:`.StreamingBody`) -- 

          Object data.

          
        

        - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not appear in the response.

          
        

        - **AcceptRanges** *(string) --* 

          Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

          
        

        - **Expiration** *(string) --* 

          If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response includes this header. It includes the ``expiry-date`` and ``rule-id`` key-value pairs providing object expiration information. The value of the ``rule-id`` is URL-encoded.

          
        

        - **Restore** *(string) --*

            - *(string) --* 
      
    
        

        - **RetentionExpirationDate** *(datetime) --* Date on which it will be legal to delete or modify the object. You can only specify this or the Retention-Period header. If both are specified a 400 error will be returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 
        

        - **RetentionLegalHoldCount** *(integer) --* Returns the count of legal holds on the object. If there are no legal holds, the header is not returned
        

        - **RetentionPeriod** *(integer) --* Retention period to store on the object in seconds. If this field and Retention-Expiration-Date are specified a 400 error is returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 0 is a legal value assuming the bucket's minimum retention period is also 0.
        

        - **SSECustomerAlgorithm** *(string) --* 

          If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

          
        

        - **SSECustomerKeyMD5** *(string) --*

        - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

          Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for all objects except for S3 Standard storage class objects.

          
        

        - **RequestCharged** *(string) --* 

          If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

          
        

        - **ReplicationStatus** *(string) --* 

          Amazon S3 can return this if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or destination in a replication rule.

          
        

        - **PartsCount** *(integer) --* 

          The count of parts this object has. This value is only returned if you specify ``partNumber`` in your request and the object was uploaded as a multipart upload.

          
        

        - **TagCount** *(integer) --* 

          The number of tags, if any, on the object.

  .. py:method:: get_available_subresources()

        
    Returns a list of all the available sub-resources for this
    Resource.
    
    :returns: A list containing the name of each sub-resource for this
        resource
    :rtype: list of str


  .. py:method:: initiate_multipart_upload(**kwargs)

    

    This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__ ). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.

     

    For more information about multipart uploads, see `Multipart Upload Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html>`__.

     

    If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see `Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config>`__.

     

    For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see `Multipart Upload and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__.

     

    For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see `Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

      After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. 

       

     

    You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use Amazon Web Services KMS keys or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__ and `UploadPartCopy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html>`__ requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using ``CreateMultipartUpload`` . 

     

    To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the ``kms:Decrypt`` and ``kms:GenerateDataKey*`` actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see `Multipart upload API and permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.

     

    For more information, see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__.

      Access Permissions  

    When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL with the ``x-amz-acl`` request header. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly with the ``x-amz-grant-read`` , ``x-amz-grant-read-acp`` , ``x-amz-grant-write-acp`` , and ``x-amz-grant-full-control`` headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__. 
     

     

    You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.

      Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers  

    You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. 

     

     
    * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer managed key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request. 

       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-context``   
       

     

    .. note::

       

      If you specify ``x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`` , but don't provide ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`` , Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key in Amazon Web Services KMS to protect the data.

       

     

    .. warning::

       

      All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by Amazon Web Services KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.

       

     

    For more information about server-side encryption with KMS key (SSE-KMS), see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__.

     
     
    * Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request. 

       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key``   
       
      * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5``   
       

     

    For more information about server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS), see `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__.

     
     

      Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers  

    You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see `Using ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:

     

     
    * Specify a canned ACL ( ``x-amz-acl`` ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs* . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL>`__. 
     
    * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use: 

       
      * ``x-amz-grant-read``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-write``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-read-acp``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-write-acp``   
       
      * ``x-amz-grant-full-control``   
       

     

    You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

     

       
      * ``id`` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account 
       
      * ``uri`` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group 
       
      * ``emailAddress`` – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account 

      .. note::

         Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:  

           
          * US East (N. Virginia) 
           
          * US West (N. California) 
           
          * US West (Oregon) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Singapore) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Sydney) 
           
          * Asia Pacific (Tokyo) 
           
          * Europe (Ireland) 
           
          * South America (São Paulo) 
           

         

        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>`__ in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

         

       
       

     

    For example, the following ``x-amz-grant-read`` header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:

     

     ``x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"``  

     
     

       

    The following operations are related to ``CreateMultipartUpload`` :

     

     
    * `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__   
     
    * `CompleteMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html>`__   
     
    * `AbortMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html>`__

    :rtype: :py:class:`s3.MultipartUpload`
    :returns: MultipartUpload resource
    

  .. py:method:: load(*args, **kwargs)

        
    Calls s3.Client.head_object to update the attributes of the ObjectSummary
    resource.


  .. py:method:: put(**kwargs)

    

    Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.

     

    Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.

     

    Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead.

     

    To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the ``Content-MD5`` header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * To successfully complete the ``PutObject`` request, you must have the ``s3:PutObject`` in your IAM permissions. 
       
      * To successfully change the objects acl of your ``PutObject`` request, you must have the ``s3:PutObjectAcl`` in your IAM permissions. 
       
      * The ``Content-MD5`` header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see `Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .  
       

       

     

     **Server-side Encryption**  

     

    You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see `Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__.

     

    If you request server-side encryption using Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Bucket Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers**  

     

    You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html>`__ and `Managing ACLs Using the REST API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html>`__. 

     

    If the bucket that you're uploading objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the ``bucket-owner-full-control`` canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return a ``400`` error with the error code ``AccessControlListNotSupported`` .

     

    For more information, see `Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    .. note::

       

      If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.

       

     

     **Storage Class Options**  

     

    By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.

     

    For more information about versioning, see `Adding Objects to Versioning Enabled Buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html>`__. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see `GetBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html>`__.

    You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview about select requests, see `Querying Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    When making a select request, do the following:

     

     
    * Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The Amazon Web Services account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see `Querying Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . For more information about the ``S3`` structure in the request body, see the following: 

       
      * `PutObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html>`__   
       
      * `Managing Access with ACLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*   
       
      * `Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*   
       

     
     
    * Define the SQL expression for the ``SELECT`` type of restoration for your query in the request body's ``SelectParameters`` structure. You can use expressions like the following examples. 

       
      * The following expression returns all records from the specified object.  ``SELECT * FROM Object``   
       
      * Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.  ``SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 > 100``   
       
      * If you have headers and you set the ``fileHeaderInfo`` in the ``CSV`` structure in the request body to ``USE`` , you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the ``fileHeaderInfo`` field to ``IGNORE`` , the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names.   ``SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s``   
       

     
     

     

    For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see `SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    When making a select request, you can also do the following:

     

     
    * To expedite your queries, specify the ``Expedited`` tier. For more information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic. 
     
    * Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results. 
     

     

    The following are additional important facts about the select feature:

     

     
    * The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy. 
     
    * You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests. 
     
    * Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response ``409`` . 
     

     

     **Restoring objects**  

     

    Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time. For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.

     

    To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

     

    When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the ``Tier`` element of the request body: 

     

     
    * ``Expedited`` - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. 
     
    * ``Standard`` - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. 
     
    * ``Bulk`` - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. 
     

     

    For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for ``Expedited`` data access, see `Restoring Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see `Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . 

     

    To get the status of object restoration, you can send a ``HEAD`` request. Operations return the ``x-amz-restore`` header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see `Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

    After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.

     

    If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html>`__ and `Object Lifecycle Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ in *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

     

     **Responses**  

     

    A successful action returns either the ``200 OK`` or ``202 Accepted`` status code. 

     

     
    * If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns ``202 Accepted`` in the response.  
     
    * If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` in the response.  
     

     

     **Special Errors**  

     

     
    * 

      
      * *Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress*   
       
      * *Cause: Object restore is already in progress. (This error does not apply to SELECT type requests.)*   
       
      * *HTTP Status Code: 409 Conflict*   
       
      * *SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client*   
       

     
     
    * 

      
      * *Code: GlacierExpeditedRetrievalNotAvailable*   
       
      * *Cause: expedited retrievals are currently not available. Try again later. (Returned if there is insufficient capacity to process the Expedited request. This error applies only to Expedited retrievals and not to S3 Standard or Bulk retrievals.)*   
       
      * *HTTP Status Code: 503*   
       
      * *SOAP Fault Code Prefix: N/A*

  .. py:method:: delete(**kwargs)

    

    Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but will still respond that the command was successful.

     

    To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the version Id subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header, ``x-amz-delete-marker`` , to true. 

     

    If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the ``x-amz-mfa`` request header in the DELETE ``versionId`` request. Requests that include ``x-amz-mfa`` must use HTTPS. 

     

    For more information about MFA Delete, see `Using MFA Delete <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMFADelete.html>`__. To see sample requests that use versioning, see `Sample Request <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html#ExampleVersionObjectDelete>`__. 

     

    You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or configure its lifecycle ( `PutBucketLifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html>`__ ) to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them the ``s3:DeleteObject`` , ``s3:DeleteObjectVersion`` , and ``s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration`` actions. 

     

    The following action is related to ``DeleteObject`` :

  .. py:method:: get(**kwargs)

    

    Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use ``GET`` , you must have ``READ`` access to the object. If you grant ``READ`` access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header.

     

    An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object ``sample.jpg`` , you can name it ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` .

     

    To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the ``GET`` operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` , specify the resource as ``/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For a path-style request example, if you have the object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` in the bucket named ``examplebucket`` , specify the resource as ``/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` . For more information about request types, see `HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket>`__.

     

    For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see `GetObjectAcl <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html>`__.

     

    If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__. Otherwise, this action returns an ``InvalidObjectStateError`` error. For information about restoring archived objects, see `Restoring Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__.

     

    Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

     

    If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:

     

     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 
     

     

    For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__.

     

    Assuming you have the relevant permission to read object tags, the response also returns the ``x-amz-tagging-count`` header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use `GetObjectTagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTagging.html>`__ to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission.

     

     
    * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error. 
     
    * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error. 
     

     

     **Versioning**  

     

    By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * If you supply a ``versionId`` , you need the ``s3:GetObjectVersion`` permission to access a specific version of an object. If you request a specific version, you do not need to have the ``s3:GetObject`` permission.  
       
      * If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes ``x-amz-delete-marker: true`` in the response. 
       

       

     

    For more information about versioning, see `PutBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html>`__. 

     

     **Overriding Response Header Values**  

     

    There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might override the ``Content-Disposition`` response header value in your GET request.

     

    You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are ``Content-Type`` , ``Content-Language`` , ``Expires`` , ``Cache-Control`` , ``Content-Disposition`` , and ``Content-Encoding`` . To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.

     

    .. note::

       

      You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.

       

     

     
    * ``response-content-type``   
     
    * ``response-content-language``   
     
    * ``response-expires``   
     
    * ``response-cache-control``   
     
    * ``response-content-disposition``   
     
    * ``response-content-encoding``   
     

     

     **Additional Considerations about Request Headers**  

     

    If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and; ``If-Unmodified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested. 

     

    If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: ``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and; ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.

     

    For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__.

     

    The following operations are related to ``GetObject`` :

     

     
    * `ListBuckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html>`__   
     
    * `GetObjectAcl <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html>`__

        - **IbmTransition** *(string) --* This header is only included if an object has transition metadata. This header will indicate the transition storage class and time of transition. If this header and the x-amz-restore header are both included, this header will indicate the time at which the object was originally archived.
    

  .. py:method:: get_available_subresources()

        
    Returns a list of all the available sub-resources for this
    Resource.
    
    :returns: A list containing the name of each sub-resource for this
        resource
    :rtype: list of str


  .. py:method:: head(**kwargs)

    

    The HEAD action retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This action is useful if you're only interested in an object's metadata. To use HEAD, you must have READ access to the object.

     

    A ``HEAD`` request has the same options as a ``GET`` action on an object. The response is identical to the ``GET`` response except that there is no response body. Because of this, if the ``HEAD`` request generates an error, it returns a generic ``404 Not Found`` or ``403 Forbidden`` code. It is not possible to retrieve the exact exception beyond these error codes.

     

    If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers:

     

     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key 
     
    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 
     

     

    For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

       

       
      * Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` , should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error. 
       
      * The last modified property in this case is the creation date of the object. 
       

       

     

    Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see `Common Request Headers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html>`__.

     

    Consider the following when using request headers:

     

     
    * Consideration 1 – If both of the ``If-Match`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: 

       
      * ``If-Match`` condition evaluates to ``true`` , and; 
       
      * ``If-Unmodified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``false`` ; 
       

     

    Then Amazon S3 returns ``200 OK`` and the data requested.

     
     
    * Consideration 2 – If both of the ``If-None-Match`` and ``If-Modified-Since`` headers are present in the request as follows: 

       
      * ``If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to ``false`` , and; 
       
      * ``If-Modified-Since`` condition evaluates to ``true`` ; 
       

     

    Then Amazon S3 returns the ``304 Not Modified`` response code.

     
     

     

    For more information about conditional requests, see `RFC 7232 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>`__.

     

     **Permissions**  

     

    You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.

     

     
    * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error. 
     
    * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error. 
     

     

    The following actions are related to ``HeadObject`` :

     

     
    * `GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html>`__   
     
    * `GetObjectAttributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAttributes.html>`__

    :param IfUnmodifiedSince: 

      Return the object only if it has not been modified since the specified time; otherwise, return a 412 (precondition failed) error.

      

    
    :type MirrorDestination: string
    :param MirrorDestination: Mirror source for object reads.

    
    :type Range: string
    :param Range: 

      Because ``HeadObject`` returns only the metadata for an object, this parameter has no effect.

      

    
    :type SSECustomerAlgorithm: string
    :param SSECustomerAlgorithm: 

      Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).

      

    
    :type SSECustomerKey: string
    :param SSECustomerKey: 

      Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`` header.

      

    
    :type SSECustomerKeyMD5: string
    :param SSECustomerKeyMD5: 

      Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not appear in the response.

          
        

        - **AcceptRanges** *(string) --* 

          Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

          
        

        - **Expiration** *(string) --* 

          If the object expiration is configured (see PUT Bucket lifecycle), the response includes this header. It includes the ``expiry-date`` and ``rule-id`` key-value pairs providing object expiration information. The value of the ``rule-id`` is URL-encoded.

          
        

        - **Restore** *(string) --* 

          If the object is an archived object (an object whose storage class is GLACIER), the response includes this header if either the archive restoration is in progress (see `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__ or an archive copy is already restored.

           

          If an archive copy is already restored, the header value indicates when Amazon S3 is scheduled to delete the object copy. For example:

           

           ``x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Fri, 21 Dec 2012 00:00:00 GMT"``  

           

          If the object restoration is in progress, the header returns the value ``ongoing-request="true"`` .

           

          For more information about archiving objects, see `Transitioning Objects\: General Considerations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-transition-general-considerations>`__.

          
        

        - **LastModified** *(datetime) --* 

          Creation date of the object.

          
        

        - **ContentLength** *(integer) --* 

          Size of the body in bytes.

          
        

        - **ETag** *(string) --* 

          An entity tag (ETag) is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.

          
        

        - **MissingMeta** *(integer) --* 

          This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in ``x-amz-meta`` headers. This can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more flexible metadata than the REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose values are not legal HTTP headers.

          
        

        - **VersionId** *(string) --* 

          Version of the object.

          
        

        - **CacheControl** *(string) --* 

          Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.

          
        

        - **ContentDisposition** *(string) --* 

          Specifies presentational information for the object.

          
        

        - **ContentEncoding** *(string) --* 

          Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

          
        

        - **ContentLanguage** *(string) --* 

          The language the content is in.

          
        

        - **ContentType** *(string) --* 

          A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.

          
        

        - **Expires** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.

          
        

        - **WebsiteRedirectLocation** *(string) --* 

          If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata.

          
        

        - **ServerSideEncryption** *(string) --* 

          If the object is stored using server-side encryption either with an Amazon Web Services KMS key or an Amazon S3-managed encryption key, the response includes this header with the value of the server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).

          
        

        - **Metadata** *(dict) --*

            - *(string) --* 
      
    
        

        - **RetentionExpirationDate** *(datetime) --* Date on which it will be legal to delete or modify the object. You can only specify this or the Retention-Period header. If both are specified a 400 error will be returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 
        

        - **RetentionLegalHoldCount** *(integer) --* Returns the count of legal holds on the object. If there are no legal holds, the header is not returned
        

        - **RetentionPeriod** *(integer) --* Retention period to store on the object in seconds. If this field and Retention-Expiration-Date are specified a 400 error is returned. If neither is specified the bucket's DefaultRetention period will be used. 0 is a legal value assuming the bucket's minimum retention period is also 0.
        

        - **SSECustomerAlgorithm** *(string) --* 

          If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will include this header confirming the encryption algorithm used.

          
        

        - **SSECustomerKeyMD5** *(string) --* 

          If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will include this header to provide round-trip message integrity verification of the customer-provided encryption key.

          
        

        - **SSEKMSKeyId** *(string) --* 

          If present, specifies the ID of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) symmetric customer managed key that was used for the object.

          
        

        - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

          Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for all objects except for S3 Standard storage class objects.

           

          For more information, see `Storage Classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html>`__.

          
        

        - **RequestCharged** *(string) --* 

          If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.

          
        

        - **ReplicationStatus** *(string) --* 

          Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or a destination in a replication rule.

           

          In replication, you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and destination bucket or buckets where Amazon S3 stores object replicas. When you request an object ( ``GetObject`` ) or object metadata ( ``HeadObject`` ) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header in the response as follows:

           

           
          * **If requesting an object from the source bucket** , Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header if the object in your request is eligible for replication. For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify object prefix ``TaxDocs`` requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix ``TaxDocs`` . Any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example ``TaxDocs/document1.pdf`` , are eligible for replication. For any object request with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating object replication status. 
           
          * **If requesting an object from a destination bucket** , Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header with value REPLICA if the object in your request is a replica that Amazon S3 created and there is no replica modification replication in progress. 
           
          * **When replicating objects to multiple destination buckets** , the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header acts differently. The header of the source object will only return a value of COMPLETED when replication is successful to all destinations. The header will remain at value PENDING until replication has completed for all destinations. If one or more destinations fails replication the header will return FAILED.  
           

           

          For more information, see `Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__.

          
        

        - **PartsCount** *(integer) --* 

          The count of parts this object has. This value is only returned if you specify ``partNumber`` in your request and the object was uploaded as a multipart upload.

          
        

        - **ObjectLockMode** *(string) --* 

          The Object Lock mode, if any, that's in effect for this object. This header is only returned if the requester has the ``s3:GetObjectRetention`` permission.
